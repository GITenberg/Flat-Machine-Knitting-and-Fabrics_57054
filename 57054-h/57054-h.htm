  <h2 class='c004'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>When the City of New York established a textile school in
1919 I was asked to take charge of the class in knitting.
Although very busy in manufacturing lines, I decided to give
up a part of my time to this educational work, believing it to
be my duty to do my bit toward helping to fill a long felt want
in the industry.</p>

<p class='c006'>There being no suitable text book available, particularly on
the elementary subjects, I was obliged to prepare my own
material for the instruction of the students. The results of
this work are contained in this volume, which is devoted to
the various types of flat latch needle machines. It is my
intention to follow this with other volumes covering circular
latch needle machines, spring needle machines, etc., with their
products.</p>

<p class='c006'>The various chapters of this work have been published in
the knitting technical section of TEXTILE WORLD but I
believe their usefulness will be increased by this revision and
publication in more convenient book form.</p>

<p class='c006'>One of the greatest needs for the advancement of the knitting
industry to the position it should occupy in the world of
textiles is available technical information, and it is hoped that
this volume with the ones to follow will supply, in some degree,
this need.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_8 c012'><span class='sc'>Machine</span> knitting is a much older industry than most
people realize, the first knitting machine having been
invented in England about the year 1590. In spite of
this early start the knitting industry has not made as great
progress as some other lines of manufacturing. The great
obstacle to its progress, in comparison with that of its rival,
the weaving industry, appears to have been the slow realization
by people in general, and the producers of knitted goods in
particular, of the possibilities of the looped fabric and the
diversified uses to which it is suited.</p>

<p class='c006'>For 250 years or more after the invention of the knitting
machine, knitted fabrics were in a general way supposed to
be fit only for hosiery. Then some enterprising knitter woke
up to the fact that knitted fabric was the ideal fabric for
underclothing to be worn next to the body, and there was
developed a great industry in knitted underwear.</p>

<p class='c006'>In very recent years, we have begun to realize that this
fabric is suitable for outer garments of various kinds, making
up into beautiful, comfortable and serviceable articles of
apparel, and the industry is surging ahead by leaps and bounds
on this line. The principal reasons for this are: first, the making
of knit fabric does not require, in its present state of
development, the technical skill required for the making of
woven fabrics, notwithstanding the fact that many people not
connected with the industry look upon machine knitting as a
most mysterious operation; second, the initial investment for
a given production is not nearly so great as for woven fabrics;
third, knitted fabrics can be produced, yard for yard, or pound
for pound, cheaper than woven fabrics.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>Knit Fabric Construction</h3>
<p class='c005'>Knitting is the art of constructing fabric or cloth with
knitting needles by an interlocking of loops. The essential
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>element of knitting is the loop, for the whole fabric is constructed
from a succession of loops.</p>

<p class='c006'>A loop is a very small length of thread, or yarn, taken at
some point at a distance from the end and drawn through, or
around, some object, usually another loop. Obviously this will
result in two loops. One of these coils around the instrument
or needle which draws it through and is called the needle loop,
shown by the letter <i>a</i> in Fig. 1. The other loops around the
object or previous loop through which it was drawn, and is
called the sinker loop, indicated by <i>b</i>, <i>b</i> in Fig. 1. These two
loops, not two complete loops, but rather one full needle loop
and two halves of the sinker loop, make a stitch, as indicated
by the shaded portion of Fig. 1 from <i>c</i> to <i>c</i>.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 1.</i><br />Sinker Loop, Needle<br />Loop and Stitch.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>A course is any number of
loops lying side by side in a line
crosswise of the fabric, as indicated
along dotted lines <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>,
Figs. 2 and 3.</p>

<p class='c006'>A wale is any number of
loops in a line succeeding one
another lengthwise of the fabric,
as indicated along dotted lines
<i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, Figs. 2 and 3.</p>

<p class='c006'>Crosswise of the fabric is
the direction in which the yarn
feeds while the fabric is in the
process of construction, forming
loops adjoining one another,
or the same direction as the
course. Lengthwise of the fabric is the direction in which the
fabric is built up by drawing one loop through another, or the
same direction as the wale. Therefore the width of the fabric
is restricted by the number of loops or needles used as a base,
while the length of the fabric has no restrictions other than
the supply of material or the will of the knitter. Rib is an
alternative expression for wale, but is applicable more particularly
where the fabric has a wale on both sides, in which case
it is shown as a rib fabric. Where a cloth has a wale on one
side only it is known as a jersey fabric, and is also sometimes
called flat goods. Rib fabrics will be taken up later for it is
my purpose to deal only with jersey or flat fabrics until the
theory of knitting is thoroughly explained.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>A Study of the Loop</h3>
<p class='c005'>A study of the loop is very important to those who wish to
acquire a knowledge of knitting, for the whole construction of
the knitted fabric is from loops.
In fact, knitted fabric is commonly
referred to as looped
fabric.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Fig. 4 shows the position or
form into which the yarn is
drawn to form the loops of a
plain jersey or flat fabric. Fig.
5 shows a second course of loops
drawn through the first. Fig. 6
shows a third course. It is
quite evident that in order to
draw each of these courses of
loops through the preceding one
there must be something to sustain
or hold the preceding
course of loops as well as the
new loops during the period in
which the new ones are being
drawn through. There must
also be something on which to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>start the first row or course of loops for, as stated before, a
loop cannot be made without something of stability to draw it
through.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is very important that the reader get firmly fixed in his
mind the curves of the loops and the most simple methods of
forming them, as he can then more readily understand the
necessary movements made on a machine. For this reason
I will first take up the most primitive method of knitting; i.e.,
hand knitting.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>Simplest Method of Forming Loops</h3>
<p class='c005'>The needles used for hand knitting are straight rods of
steel, wood, bone or celluloid. Not less than two of these needles
must be used as indicated in Figs. 7, 8 and 9. To start we take
the yarn and make a small slip knot or noose, with which we
are all familiar, slip one needle through the loop thus made and
draw the yarn up so that it fits around the needle loosely.</p>

<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 9.</i><br />Forming Loops by Hand, Completed.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We now have the cornerstone
laid. Holding this needle
in the left hand with the fore-finger
bearing lightly on the
loop, we take the other needle
in the right hand and slip it
through the loop as in Fig. 7,
next draw the yarn over the
end of the right hand needle as
shown, then draw this needle
back to the point where it will
pass the left side of the loop on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>the right hand needle, but not far enough to allow the yarn
that was placed over the end to drop off. Then we draw this
yarn through as indicated in Fig. 8, and we will have the
second loop.</p>

<p class='c006'>At this point in the building up of the fabric we would slip
the previous loop off the left hand needle and let it hang on
the newly formed loop on the right hand needle, as in Fig. 9,
but as we are not as yet building, but only laying the foundation,
we slip this new loop back on the left hand needle, where
we now have two loops. The next step is to take the right
hand needle, slip it through the second loop, and proceed as
with the first, then slip the third loop back on the left hand
needle. This procedure is repeated until there are sufficient
loops to make the fabric the width wanted. We now have our
foundation on which to build.</p>

<p class='c006'>Figs, 7, 8 and 9 give a very clear illustration of the method
of building up the knit fabric by hand knitting after the first
course. It should be noted, however, that after the right hand
needle has completed the new course, and the last loop has been
dropped off the left hand needle, the right hand needle with
its full number of loops is shifted to the left hand and the
empty needle then becomes the working needle in the right
hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>This first course of stitches, it should be noted, has the
needle loop only, the sinker loop being tied in to form a base
or edge from which to start. Fig. 7 shows the first position to
form the loops with two needles. One full course is on the
needle lettered <i>a</i>, while needle <i>b</i> is thrust through the first loop
of the last course and receiving yarn to draw through a new
loop.</p>

<p class='c006'>Fig. 8 shows the new
loop drawn through, while
Fig. 9 shows the old or
preceding loop cast off
from needle <i>a</i> and hanging
from the new loop on
needle <i>b</i>.</p>

the crochet stitch, which
is taken up at this point
to show its similarity to
the knitted loop and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>explain the points of difference. The illustrations show very
plainly the method of forming crochet loops and they also
show that this stitch is simply a single chain or wale of loops
succeeding one another.</p>

<p class='c006'>When crochet work is to be made into a fabric, the hooked
needle is pushed through the side of another loop at the point
at which it is to be joined, and the new loop is drawn through
this old loop as well as the one on the needle. There is never
more than one loop used at a time in making this work.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In the knitted fabric the loops are laid side by side and
there are a sufficient number of loops being used at all times
to make the width of fabric desired. The wales are bound
together by the yarn passing from one loop to the next adjoining
one, thereby forming the sinker loops which have already
been explained.</p>

<p class='c006'>Figs. 12 and 13 are photographic reproductions of a piece
of closely knitted jersey or flat goods. The stitch formation
in this cloth is exactly the same as shown in the line drawings
at Figs. 2 and 3.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>It may be well to state here in passing, that all textile fibres
have more or less flexibility or resiliency, and while this
characteristic is infinitely small in any single fibre or hair, it
is quite appreciable when there are hundreds of fibres grouped
together and twisted into a yarn. This is the reason for the
elasticity or stretch in knitted fabrics.</p>

<p class='c006'>It will be noticed in Fig. 2 that in forming the loops the
curvature or bend of the thread is gradual and uniform. When
this yarn is knitted into fabric and both top or needle loop, and
bottom or sinker loop are attached to or drawn through other
and like loops, and we pull or stretch the fabric, we draw
sharp curves or corners in the yarn where it passes around
the preceding and succeeding loops. When we let go or take
the strain off the fabric, the natural tendency of the fibre to
straighten out or take an easier curve brings the fabric back
into its original position.</p>

<p class='c006'>I would suggest that the reader take any straight piece of
yarn, worsted if available, form a loop, and hold it between
the thumb and finger of one hand, then press the loop together
with the thumb and finger of the other hand and demonstrate
for himself this characteristic of textile fibres.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_8 c012'><span class='sc'>Although</span> what is known as the spring beard needle
was a part of the original invention of the knitting
machine, and was in use more than 200 years before the
latch needle was invented, I am taking up the latch needle
machine first for two reasons. First, because the latch needle
type of machine is most largely used and is more popular in
this country today than any
other type; and second, because I
believe it can be more easily understood
by a person who is not
familiar with machine knitting.</p>

<div  class='figleft id004'>
<img src='images/i016.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 14.</i><br />Latch Needles.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In machine knitting of every
kind there must be a needle for
every loop, and therein lies the
fundamental difference between
machine and hand knitting.
Latch needles, however, are constructed
entirely different from the straight plain hand needles.
Fig. 14 shows the construction of the latch needle. It will be
noted by looking at the latches on the three needles that they
swing freely on a pin or rivet lengthwise of the needle, but
have no movement sidewise.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>Types of Latch Needle</h3>
<p class='c005'>The hook, latch, rivet, cheek, throat and stem are substantially
the same except in size in all latch needles, but the balance
of the needle may and does vary in shape to a marked degree in
the various types and makes of machines. Fig. 15 shows many
of the different types of butts and shanks made, as well as the
variation in the sizes of the hooks and the thickness of the
needles, but it should be understood that the type of the butt
and shank has no bearing on the size of the hook and stem, as
each type is made in the various sizes and is governed only
by the size of the yarn to be used.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Fig. 16 is a very important illustration and the reader
should study it well and mentally digest every position of the
needles, for here is shown a complete cycle of the movements
necessary to make the knitted loop on a latch needle machine
of the type in which the needles slide back and forth, lengthwise
of the needle, in what are called tricks, or more commonly
expressed, slots. Probably 95 per cent. or more of the latch
needle machines in use today are of the type in which the
needle slides back and forth in slots in the operation of forming
the loops.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 15.</i><br />Some of the Various Types of Latch Needles.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 class='c013'>Explanation of Lamb Type Machine</h3>
<p class='c005'>A study of Fig. 16 should be made in connection with the
photographic reproductions, Figs. 17 and 18. Fig. 18 shows
substantially the whole knitting machine, while Fig. 17 is a
close-up view of that part of the machine which actually does
the knitting. Fig. 16 shows the principle used to operate the
needles.</p>

<p class='c006'>This type of machine was invented in 1863 by Isaac W.
Lamb, a clergyman, and was made possible only by the invention
of the latch needle in England about 1847. It is very
simple in construction in the plain models and is the most
versatile of all the knitting machines, it being possible to make
on it a larger variety of stitches and articles of apparel than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>on any other machine. It is known as the flat or Lamb type of
machine.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has two flat or straight horizontal plates or beds about
one-half inch thick by 6 inches wide, the length of which varies
from 6 inches or less to 60 inches or more, according to the
width of fabric it is designed to make. These plates are set in
a frame, parallel to each other lengthwise, and at an angle of
about 90 degrees to each other and 45 degrees to the horizontal.
See Figs. 16, 17 and 20.</p>

<p class='c006'>All flat machines of this type have two needle plates, but
for our purpose of knitting jersey fabric we need but one,
therefore we will imagine that there are two in Fig. 16 but the
back one having no needles in it cannot do any knitting. The
needles, as will be noted in Fig. 16, are placed in tricks or
slots of which there may be any number from 2½ up to 18 in
one inch, according to the size of the yarn to be used. The
needles should fit in the slots close enough so that they will not
have any chance to tip sidewise, yet they must move easily endwise.
The gib <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, is for holding the needles in the plate, and
of course is removed by drawing out endwise when a needle
is to be put in or taken out of the plate. The plate is secured
in a frame indicated by the letter <i>n</i> in Fig. 16, and the frame
is attached to a stationary stand or table.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cams <i>a</i>-1, <i>a</i>-2 and <i>a</i>-3 are attached to the carriage <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>,
<i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, Fig, 17, at a point just below <i>a</i>-1, <i>a</i>-2 and <i>a</i>-3 and the
carriage, together with the cams, rests and slides freely back
and forth on the ways <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, while the plate and needles remain
stationary. The cams are secured to the carriage in a position
so that they come very close to the needle plates. They should
be set as close as possible and not rub the plate as they are
moved back and forth.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may be well to explain here that a cam in any machine is
a piece of hardened steel of the proper shape and construction
to cause some other part of the machine to make the proper
movements to perform its functions. In this instance they
actuate the needles by coming in contact with the butts.</p>

<p class='c006'>It will be noted that each one of the needles from <i>e</i> to <i>e</i>,
Fig. 16, has a loop in the hook except from the point where they
are rising over the cam <i>a</i>-3, and on these the loops rest on the
shank. It should be understood that the fabric back of the
needle plate has a weight on it, thereby giving to each loop a
downward pull. The fabric and weights may be seen in Fig. 18.</p>

<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 16.</i><br />Principle Used to Form Loops on a Machine.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Now bear in mind that the cams <i>a</i>-1, <i>a</i>-2 and <i>a</i>-3, Fig. 16,
are attached to the carriage <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, Fig. 17, at points underneath
<i>a</i>-1, <i>a</i>-2 and <i>a</i>-3. These cams are moving from right to
left and as the lower left hand corner of <i>a</i>-3 is below the line
of the butts of the needles from <i>e</i> to <i>e</i>, they, the needles, must
of necessity slide upward in the slots along the edge of this
cam. When they get to the top it will be noted that the latches
of the needles are above and clear of the loops. As the cams
move farther along, the cam <i>a</i>-2 comes in contact with the
butts and slides them down again. As the needles move downward
the hooks catch the thread <i>i</i> which lies in their path, and
as at <i>l</i> the stitch that is on the needle closes the latch as the
needle slides downward. As the needle moves farther down
the hook draws a new loop through the old one, while the
latch closing up the hook allows the old loop to slip over the
end (needle <i>m</i>), and the pull of the fabric draws it down on to
the new loop.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 17.</i><br />Top Side of Carriage, Over Cams.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The thin portions of the needle plate indicated by the
letter <i>h</i> in Fig. 16, which extend upwards, are called jacks and
these hold that part of the stitch called sinker loops while the
needle is drawing through the new needle loop.</p>

<p class='c006'>Below each needle is a U-shaped spring, <i>j</i>, <i>j</i>, and <i>k</i>, <i>k</i>,
Fig. 16, which holds the needles up in the working position.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>They extend down to and around the bottom of the plate and
up against the under side of the plate. The end that is under
the plate is a little longer than the end that slides up in the
slot below the needle. These U-springs are made so that before
they are put in their places on the plate, the ends come together,
so when they are spread and pushed on to the plate they act as
a clamp to hold the needles in position. They are not attached
to the needles, but simply clamp the plate with tension enough
to hold them up or down, as the case may be, and the bottom
end of the needles rests on them. This construction leaves the
knitter in a position to pull d own out of working position as
many needles as he may wish, therefore he may make his fabric
any desired width by pulling needles down out of the working
line or pushing them up into the working line, thereby adding
to or taking away stitches.</p>

<p class='c006'>The letter <i>d</i> in Fig. 17 designates the yarn carrier through
which the yarn passes, and which guides the yarn along the path
of the hooks of the needles. After having moved the carriage
clear across the working needles, and finishing a course of
loops, the carriage is moved back in the opposite direction and
another course is put on. This is done in exactly the same way
except that the cams must necessarily push or slide the needles
up and down on the opposite sides of the cams: i.e., the butts
slide up on the right hand side of the V-cam or cam <i>a</i>-3 in
Fig. 16 and down the right hand side of cam <i>a</i>-1, or stitch
cam. This operation is continued until the fabric is of the
desired length.</p>

<p class='c006'>Needles are operated at a rate of speed that would make
500 or more stitches per minute per needle if the machine would
keep them in continuous operation, but in practical work they
make from 50 to 200 stitches per minute according to the size
of the machine as more time is consumed as a rule in the
movements of the machine between the stitches than is used
in the actual knitting operation. On account of this speed of
operation the latches of the needles must be under control at
all points in the cycle of knitting; that is, from <i>f</i> to <i>g</i> in Fig. 16.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>Control of Latches</h3>
<p class='c005'>It will be noted that needle <i>o</i> in Fig. 16 has just started to
rise and the stitch that was in the hook has opened the latch
and still has it under control. When this needle gets up to
the position of needle <i>p</i> it has passed the point where the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>stitch can control the latch, therefore, other means must be
provided or it would be very liable to fly up and close the
hook, in which case it would be impossible for the hook to
catch the yarn for the next stitch. When this happens we have
what is called a drop stitch, and after the yarn had passed
there would be no stitch on the needle.</p>

<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 18.</i><br />Flat Latch Needle Machine.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>To provide against this there is used in this type of machine
a long narrow thin bristle brush set over the needles and at the
proper angle and distance to just clear the latches. This
brush is shown in Fig. 19. The letter a indicates the brush
alone, and at <i>b</i> is shown the brush in the fixture which carries

with the brushes removed in order to make clear the operation
of the needles.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>A fabric made according to the foregoing explanations
would be what is known as a jersey fabric (see Figs. 12 and
13), but it would be a flat piece of fabric when finished. Perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>to make it plainer I should say that if the fabric were
laid out on a table it would be a single thickness, and if it were
to be made into a garment it would be necessary to double it
over and sew the edges together to make it tubular, or in the
form of a bag. If we wish to make the fabric tubular on the
machine to save the labor of seaming it, and also prevent the
unsightly seam, it would be necessary to use the needles in
both plates, front and back. The cams would then be set by
means provided, which will be explained later, so that when the
carriage is moved in one direction, say from left to right, the
front cams will operate the front needles and the back cams will
be put out of operation; and when the carriage is moved from
right to left, the back cams will operate the back needles and
the front cams will be put out of work.</p>

<p class='c006'>By continuing the operation of the machine in this manner
of having only the front cams operate while moving the carriage
in one direction, and only the back cams operate when the
carriage is moved in the opposite direction, there would be produced
a tubular fabric as shown in Fig. 21. The yarn must of
a necessity go across from front needles to back ones, and from
back ones to front ones each time the direction of the movement
of the carriage is changed, thereby closing up both sides of the
fabric.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>Range of Jersey Fabric</h3>
</div>
<p class='c005'>The jersey type of fabric is very popular with the consuming
public and is used for quite a wide range of garments in many
different weights and materials. Milady may easily be dressed
throughout, with the exception of shoes, in jersey cloth, and still
be up to the minute with her clothes. She may have on silk
stockings which are made with the jersey stitch. Her underwear,
most surely is made of silk jersey fabric. Then she may
wear a tricolet waist, which is silk jersey fabric, with a worsted
jersey cloth suit. Also she might easily have her fall and winter
coat made from the heavyweight fulled jersey cloth, and carry
a heavy Shaker sweater, which is also the jersey stitch, on
her motor trips into the country.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is a far cry from the finest and lightest to the heaviest
and coarsest in jersey cloth. Figs. 22 and 23 show two
extremes. Fig. 22 is a sample of fine fabric and has 32 stitches
to one inch; while Fig. 23 is used for what is known as the
Shaker sweater and has 3½ stitches to one inch. Between
these come men’s balbriggan underwear and the flat woolen
underwear, the jersey bathing suits, tricolet, and the fulled
jersey cloth for ladies’ suits and coats, etc. This stitch is
also the basic one for medium priced knit neckties, as well as
knit mittens and gloves, except the very lightest and thinnest.</p>

indicated underwear fabric made tubular in the jersey stitch

tubular rib fabric made on latch needle machines. At present,
in the localities where mills are using both the circular and flat
straight needle bed machines, it is generally understood that
a flat fabric is a fabric of single thickness made on a flat
machine, regardless of the stitch, and any fabric made on a
circular machine is known as a tubular fabric. If the stitch

<p class='c006'>This latter custom appears to me to be the more logical;
therefore, when these terms are used hereafter in this work
it should be understood that flat fabric means cloth of a
single thickness made on a flat machine, or a tubular fabric
cut open so it will lie out flat. The “flat goods” of the old time
knitters will be called jersey cloth or fabric.</p>

<p class='c006'>We will now leave the jersey fabrics for a time, as the
making of the tuck stitch and plated work in the jersey stitch
are more or less complicated and had better be left until we take
up fancy stitches and designs on circular latch needle machines.
The tuck stitch is never used in the jersey fabrics on flat
machines.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>Rib Fabrics</h3>
<p class='c005'>A rib fabric is one which has a rib or wale on both sides
of the cloth. It has much more stretch or elasticity than
cloth of the jersey group; about twice as much, generally
speaking. The elasticity of either one, however, may be varied
to a marked degree by changing the length of loop drawn.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Rib fabric is peculiarly adapted for such garments or
parts of garments as should be close fitting, such as ladies’
undergarments, cuffs for all kinds of knitted garments, tops
of half hose, etc. Fig. 24 shows very clearly the course the
yarn takes to form this stitch. It would be well to study this
drawing in connection with Figs. 2 and 3 and note carefully
the different course the yarn takes in order to form a wale
on both sides of the fabric. A photographic reproduction of
a plain rib fabric showing both sides is given at <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, in Fig. 25.</p>

<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 24.</i><br />Construction of a Plain<br />Rib Fabric.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>A properly constructed plain 1 and 1 rib fabric, such as is
shown in Fig. 24, should be alike on both sides. Very often
this is not the case. A little carelessness on the part of the
adjuster in not drawing the
stitch the same length on both
sides will make a difference on
the flat machines, while it is
impossible to make them the
same on an ordinary circular
machine on account of the principles
of construction of this
machine.</p>

<p class='c006'>Fig. 26 is a view of a flat
machine making the rib stitch,
looking down from above. It
almost fully explains the method
of making this stitch to those who have carefully read and
understand the principles of making the jersey stitch. In this
illustration the carriage is moving from right to left, and both
front and back cams are in operation, therefore both front and
back needles are working.</p>

<p class='c006'>It should be noted that the back plate is set so that the
needles of that plate come up at a point in the middle of the
spaces between the needles of the front plate. The cams,
front and back, being made exactly alike and set exactly opposite
one another, must push the needles of both plates up at the
same time and draw them down at the same time. When we
feed the yarn, indicated by the letter <i>a</i> in Fig. 26, down
through the guide, <i>b</i>, it is drawn into loops from both sides
alternately, as shown at <i>c</i>, by the opposite sets of needles,
thereby making stitches, or ribs, or wales, on both sides of
the fabric. This is the plain 1 and 1 rib stitch.</p>

  <h3 class='c013'>Varieties of Rib</h3>
</div>
<p class='c005'>This stitch, by distortion, or by manipulation of the yarns
or needles, or by a combination of two or all three of these
things, can produce a number of fabrics different both in
appearance and feel. To enumerate the principal ones, there
are the half cardigan or tuck stitch, also sometimes called royal
rib; the full cardigan, and the rack stitch with the rack on
one side of the fabric and the double rack which shows the
rack on both sides of the fabric. Then there is the zig-zag
stitch, which is quite simple to make but is quite a puzzle to
those not familiar with it. There is also the cotton back, which
is a well known and popular fabric in the sweater trade.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then there are many varieties of ribs made either in plain
or in combination with one or more of the above by taking
needles out of the machine at predetermined places, or by the
Jacquard system of selecting needles. There is also the system
of making designs by the cut pressers and pattern wheels,
which is used on circular machines only.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>Half Cardigan or Tuck Stitch</h3>
<p class='c005'>The half cardigan or tuck stitch is used more than any
other of the ribbed group, though it is generally used in
combination with the plain rib. The body and sleeves of the
ordinary rib sweater, and much of the rib underwear produced,
are made in this stitch while the cuffs are plain rib. The
reason for this is that the half cardigan rib will knit up considerably
wider, with the same number of needles, than the plain
rib, therefore it is possible to make a shaped garment without
cutting and sewing up again. Also the plain rib comes out
lighter and thinner so makes a more desirable cuff for sweaters
and underwear. It also has more life or spring to it, which
is another desirable feature.</p>

<p class='c006'>The half cardigan or tuck stitch is the one that is almost
invariably used in making the well known cotton back sweaters.
It is believed by many people who are familiar with this fabric
that the back stitch of cotton does not come through on the
face, but in this they are mistaken. The face stitch does not
go through on the back, but the back yarn does go through
on the face.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 27.</i><br />Construction of a Half Cardigan<br />Rib Fabric.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Fig. 27 is a line drawing
showing the course the yarn
takes in making this stitch and
a careful examination of it
will demonstrate to the reader
that this is the case. The dotted
line <i>e</i>, <i>e</i>, indicates the wale on
the face and <i>f</i>, <i>f</i>, shows the wale
on the back. It will be noted
that the back stitches of yarn
come through to the face of the
fabric and connect the preceding
and succeeding stitches, <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>,
the same as in the plain rib,
but there is this difference, in
the plain rib these face stitches are, or should be, just the same
length, while in the half cardigan, on account of the back stitch
of this course holding over for one course, it necessarily draws
a longer stitch in the back and the yarn for this long stitch
must come from the face stitch, thereby making this face stitch
very short.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the drawing the stitches are not proportioned just as
they lie in the actual fabric, for if they were it would be very
difficult to trace their course. In the fabric the stitches <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>
are so short that they are almost completely covered by the
large, full, round stitches, <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>. These stitches are full and
large from the fact that where they go through to the back they
do not form a loop but simply cross over the back loop as at <i>d</i>,
without being drawn through. These are completely covered
by the loops <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, in the back wale.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>How the Half Cardigan or Tuck Stitch Is Made</h3>
<p class='c005'>The diagram at Fig. 28 shows the method used to make
the half cardigan or tuck stitch on a flat machine. The cams
shown are what are known as the Lamb system and are called
the automatic cardigan or drop locks. The word “locks,” as
applied to the flat knitting machine, means a full set of cams
attached to the cam plates ready to affix to the carriage. There
are a number of different systems of constructing these locks,
but the one selected is the most simple of all and for this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>reason is used for illustration first. The others will be taken
up at the proper place.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i031.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 28.</i><br />Automatic Locks for Making Half or Full Cardigan Fabrics.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In Fig. 28 only a part of the needle plates are shown. They
are attached to a frame at an angle of 90° to each other and 45°
to the horizontal as explained before. The cams are shown in
working position with the carriage (to which they are attached
when in use) removed. As indicated by the thread <i>h</i>, they
are being moved toward the far end.</p>

<p class='c006'>It should be noted that the automatic drop V-cams <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, are
in different positions. These cams are made so that they swing
freely on the pivots <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, and the swing is inside of the limits of
the positions of the two cams in the drawing. It is controlled
by pins on the top side of the swinging ends, the pins coming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>through a slot of the proper length in the cam plate to stop
them at the right place.</p>

<p class='c006'>When starting to move these locks from the near end toward
the far end, the cam <i>a</i>, on the left, might be in any position
within the limits of the before mentioned slot in the cam plate,
but the instant it comes in contact with the butts of the needles
it is automatically forced to the position shown.</p>

<p class='c006'>In making the half cardigan stitch the right hand cam is
held up to the top, as shown, at all times by means provided.
This position forces the needles high enough so that the latches
are above and clear of the loop that is on the needle, therefore
when the needles are drawn down again by the cam <i>f</i>, they
draw new loops and cast the old ones off over the latch and
hook, and they drop down on the new loop, just as explained
in describing how to make the plain rib. This refers only to
the needles in the right plate.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cam <i>a</i>, on the left side, however, having been swung
down to its lowest position by contact with the needle butts,
raises the needles only about one-half of the normal distance.
Or to put it differently, the needles raise high enough to open
the latches and catch the yarn when being drawn down again,
but not high enough to permit the loop that is on the needle
to slide down below the latch. Therefore, after the completion
of the course we have the right side with the new loop drawn
through the old one as in plain rib, but the left side still retains
the old or previous loop and also the new one as at <i>j</i>. This
leaves two loops on every needle on the left side and one on
the right when the course is completed.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the return course, from the far end to the near end,
when the point <i>i</i> of the left cam, <i>a</i>, comes in contact with the
first needle it must swing up in the same position as the right
cam, <i>a</i>, therefore all the needles will draw the new loop through
the two preceding ones and clear themselves, leaving only one
loop on each needle as in the plain rib.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the next course, from the near end to the far end, the
left hand needles again hold the old loop and take on a new
one as just explained, while the right hand needles cast off the
old ones and hold only the new ones.</p>

<p class='c006'>To condense the operation into a few words let us say that
the left hand needles always must hold the two stitches while
moving in one direction, and clear them off and hold only one
on the return course; while the right hand needles always cast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>off the old stitch and hold the new ones only. The right hand
needles would make the face side of the fabric.</p>

<p class='c006'>The writer has made a special effort to explain the formation
of this particular stitch, and the reader should make the
same effort to get this formation clear in his mind, for this
stitch is the base of almost all of the fancy stitches or design
work which will be taken up later. The system used in design
work is of course entirely different from the one just described,
being what might be called a selective system, that is, a method
whereby the designer may select the proper needles at the
proper time and place to make the tuck stitches block out the
design wanted.</p>

<p class='c006'>Fig. 25, at band <i>c</i>, shows the tuck or half cardigan stitch; <i>b</i>
is the face and <i>c</i> is the back. If studied carefully the reader
will notice that the face side, <i>b</i>, has a full round stitch, while <i>c</i>,
or the back of the fabric, has a small narrow stitch.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>The Full Cardigan Stitch</h3>
<p class='c005'>The full cardigan stitch is not nearly so generally used as
the half cardigan and plain rib stitches. It is seldom if ever
used in making underwear or any fine fabrics. When it is
made it is usually used for sweater fabrics or other novelty
wearing apparel of this character.</p>

<div  class='figleft id005'>
<img src='images/i033.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 29.</i><br />Construction of a Full Cardigan Fabric.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>A line drawing of the full
cardigan stitch is shown in
Fig. 29. This stitch, as its
name would indicate, is made in
the same way as the half cardigan
only the stitches are held
alternately on both rows of
needles on alternate courses.
Referring again to Fig. 28, in
making the full cardigan stitch
the cams would operate exactly
the same while moving toward
the far end as shown and explained
for the half cardigan.
But the means provided to hold the right hand cam, <i>a</i>, at the
top position would have been removed, so that on the return
from the far to the near end this cam would be thrown down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>to the same position as the left hand cam, <i>a</i>, is shown, while
this left hand cam would be forced up into the position in which
the right hand cam is now shown. In other words, the stitch
would be the same with the carriage or cams moving in either
direction, only it would alternate on each course from one
row of needles to the other.</p>

<p class='c006'>We will refer back to Fig. 25, which shows both sides of a
piece of fabric with the three stitches we have just discussed
in one piece. This shows quite plainly the individual characteristics
of each. All have the same number of needles or wales,
the same yarn was used, on the same machine; yet how
different the results!</p>

<p class='c006'>The most marked difference is in the width. There is
proportionately the same difference in the thickness, but this
cannot very well be shown. It should be observed that the
stitch or loops of the plain rib <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, and the full cardigan <i>d</i>, <i>d</i>,
are the same on both sides of the fabric, while the stitches in
the half cardigan, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>, are not. It will be noted also that
the stitch of the plain rib is much smaller than that of the two
cardigans, also that the wales or ribs hug very close together in
the plain rib, while they are separated more or less in the
cardigans.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_8 c012'><span class='sc'>The</span> rack stitch is used on many sweaters for a border on

the collar and the border down the front made separately in
the rack stitch and sewed on. Most of the designs in the
knitted neckties made on flat machines are based on the rack
stitch. Another very important use for this stitch is in making
a smooth sightly edge on the bottom of sweaters, the ends of
cuffs, etc.</p>

<p class='c006'>The rack stitch is always made on one of the cardigans.
From this statement the reader will realize that this stitch is
not made in place of the half or full cardigan, or any other

stitches.</p>

</div>
</div>

</div>
<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c006'>Fig. 30 shows a half cardigan stitch ready to rack, as it is
customary to make the one needle rack on this stitch. It
should be noticed that the racking is done on the course that
holds, or does not cast the previous stitch off on one side.
Fig. 31 shows the stitch after the plate has been racked over
one needle. This illustration practically explains the whole
principle of the rack stitch. The rack will show on the side
that casts the stitches off the needles. It is customary to hold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>the stitch or tuck on the back plate, therefore the rack shows
on the front side of the fabric, or the side toward the operator
of the machine.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>Operation of Racking</h3>
<p class='c005'>It is understood, of course, that on a flat machine there
must always be an end needle on one plate or the other.
Usually the knitter sets up his machine with one plate carrying
the end needle on one side of the work and the other plate
carrying the other end needle. Which end of the respective
plates carries this needle depends on the position of the racking
cam. In the illustration, Fig. 30, the front plate has the end
needle on the right and back plate has the end needle on the
left. After racking as in Fig. 31, these positions are reversed.
It will be noted that the front plate has been racked or moved
over one needle so the front needles will come up through
and operate between the next two needles to the left of their
previous positions.</p>

<p class='c006'>Or to explain it in a different way, in Fig. 30, before racking,
the front plate has the end needle on the right and operates
outside of the last needle in the back plate, but after racking,
as in Fig. 31, this end needle on the front plate has been shifted
over so it comes up inside the last needle in the back plate.</p>

<p class='c006'>After racking over one needle there must be one full round
or two courses put on before racking again; that is while
racking on the half cardigan stitch, and then the plate is
racked back to the first position. This operation of racking
first one way and then the other with a round between each
rack is continued until the necessary number of racks are
finished and then the operator proceeds with the plain half
cardigan.</p>

<p class='c006'>This procedure would make a plain rack on one side of the
fabric only. We have assumed in this explanation that the
back is stationary and the front plate is the one that moves,
but I wish to have it understood here that it makes no difference
which plate is stationary and which one racks or is movable;
the results are the same.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some writers use the words shog or shogged in place of
rack or racked, but the writer of this work has avoided the
use of these words as they are seldom or never used by the
practical knitter, at least not in this country.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>The Racking Mechanism</h3>
</div>
<p class='c005'>In most of the modern flat machines the plate that racks has
enough end clearance to rack over at least two needles, and
some of them as many as four, though racking two needles is
sufficient for all ordinary work. Fig. 32 shows the method of
racking or moving the plate to make the rack stitch, or at
least this is the principle used as a rule on the imported
machines, with some modifications by some makers. This also
applies to the method shown of attaching the plates to the
frame.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i037.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 32.</i><br />The Racking Cam, Ratchet and Studs.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>There is a large flat bottom hole, <i>c</i>, bored about half way
through the plate; through the bottom of this hole there is
made an elongated hole, <i>b</i>, through which the plate is attached
to the frame by the shouldered screw, <i>a</i>, the head of which is
flush with the top of the plate. It will readily be seen that
with this method the plate cannot be moved in any direction
except lengthwise of the plate, or crosswise of the needles. To
secure this movement at will there is a steel strap, <i>d</i>, attached
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>to the under side of the plate by the screws <i>j</i> and <i>k</i>, and
through the outside end of this strap there are two elongated
holes through which are attached two shouldered studs with
nuts <i>e</i> and <i>f</i>. These studs extend down on both sides of the
steps of the racking cam, <i>g</i>, and together with the plate are
moved back and forth by the steps on the racking cam. The
cam is moved by the handle, <i>i</i>, in the hand machines, or by
the ratchet, <i>h</i>, being operated by pawls or dogs in power
machines.</p>

<p class='c006'>The letter <i>h</i> shows a front elevation of the ratchet, while <i>i</i>
is a side view. It will be noted that there are only three teeth
on each side, and these two groups are opposed one to the
other. If the reader will examine the racking cam, <i>g</i>, with
due thought the reason for this will be obvious. There are
three steps on the cam and the cam must have an oscillating
movement and not a rotary one. The ratchet, <i>h</i>, and the racking
cam, <i>g</i>, are both attached securely to one hub, therefore
must move together on a stud which projects from the end
of the frame.</p>

<p class='c006'>The plate as illustrated in Fig. 32, sets at the limit of its
movement to the left, consequently any racking that is to be
done must move the plate to the right, therefore the pawl at
the top of the ratchet would engage the uppermost tooth, <i>q</i>, and
turning the ratchet one tooth would move the racking cam
one step, thus moving the plate over one needle through its
contact with the studs, <i>e</i> and <i>f</i>. There are two pawls, upper
and lower, arranged to engage the teeth on the ratchet either
at the top or the bottom as required. If we wanted a one-needle
rack only, after putting on one round of stitches we
would have the lower pawl engage the tooth, <i>n</i>, of the ratchet
and move the racking cam back to its first position. If, however,
we wanted a two-needle rack, the upper pawl would
engage the second tooth, <i>o</i>, of the ratchet. For three racks it
would then engage the next tooth, <i>m</i>, after which it would be
necessary to start on the return to the first position, remembering
to put on one course or one round, as the case may be, of
stitches between each rack. If racking on the half cardigan
stitch there should be one full round between the racks, but if
on the full cardigan the racking may be done every half round
or every course, as will be explained hereafter.</p>

<p class='c006'>Fig. 33 is a photographic reproduction of a piece of fabric,
face and back, of a one-needle rack which shows on one side
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>of the fabric only. A fabric with the two-needle rack which
would show on both sides of the fabric is not illustrated, for
it would be the same on both sides as the face side of Fig. 33.
A line drawing of the rack stitch is shown at Fig. 34. This
is drawn out of proportion and is very loose and not like the
fabric, but by making it this way the direction the yarn takes
may be easily located.</p>

<p class='c006'>The points come where the
rack is skipped, or in other
words the direction of the diagonal
stitch will continue in the
same direction as long as the
needle plate is racked every
course without skipping, but
immediately one rack is missed
the stitch starts diagonally in
the other direction. It is obvious
from the foregoing explanation
that the knitter is not
obliged to use any set number
of courses between the change,
but may use any number at his
discretion to get the distance
desired between the points.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>Shaped Collar for Sweaters</h3>

<p class='c005'>The peculiar characteristic of this stitch is utilized in making
a shaped collar for sweaters, as shown in Figs. 38 and 39.
First let the reader remember that the direction the diagonal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>stitch takes all depends on which end of the machine the
carriage is at when the racking operation begins. It should
be understood that the collars are made in a long string and
the three parts, as shown in Fig. 38, are duplicated one after
another. On either end, where this piece has been cut off,
there was a duplicate of the plain racked piece shown at the
middle, and at the end of these there was another diagonal
piece, and so on from the beginning to the end.</p>

<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 38.</i><br />Shaped Collar for Sweaters as Knit.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It should be clear to the
reader that if the piece shown
(Fig. 38) were cut through on
the broken lines we would have
one complete collar and we
would have left the diagonal
stitch that belongs on one end
of each of the two adjoining
center pieces, therefore by cutting
all the collars apart at the
point indicated by the line we
would have our collars shaped
without any waste and would
have a selvage or finished edge
on the outside.</p>

<div  class='figleft id005'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 39.</i><br />Shaped Collar Folded.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The collar is stitched or sewed on the neck opening of the
sweater along the cut edge and across the bottom of the racked
center piece, and after it is finished and the sweater coat
buttoned up it folds over and looks as shown in Fig. 39. As
stated before this collar can be made on a machine that racks
over only one needle, but in that case the center piece would
be racked on one side only, therefore it is customary to make
these collars on a two needle rack machine with the middle
portion racked on both sides as will be noted in Fig. 39.</p>

<p class='c006'>Making a rack on both sides of the fabric is very much like
making the diagonal stitch in the operation of the machine,
even though the resultant fabric is so radically different. It
should be made with a full cardigan stitch same as the zig-zag
or diagonal, and the needle plate must be racked every course
or half round, but with this difference: When making the
diagonal stitch the needle plate is racked over one needle and
back again, while to rack both sides of the fabric the needle
plate is racked over two needles. This does not mean that the
knitter should rack over two needles at once, for this should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>never be done, but rack over one needle, let us say to the right,
then put on one course and rack over the second needle to the
right, put on one course and rack one needle to the left, put
on one course and rack the second needle to the left. Or in
other words, rack alternately two needles to the right and
left and put on one course or half round each time the needle
plate is racked one needle.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is one other point that should be remembered in making
this collar and that is the manner of starting the diagonal
stitch in the proper direction after finishing in the middle
portion. Each time this part is finished the diagonal stitch
should go in the opposite way from the previous time, therefore
when the one needle half round rack starts to make this stitch
the first rack should be made with the carriage on the opposite
side of the machine from which the previous one was started.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>Opportunity for Varying Designs</h3>
<p class='c005'>Fig. 37 is an interesting example of what may be done
with the two-needle rack. Designs of this character require
the removal or pulling down out of operation of every other
needle, therefore a machine of any given cut, or needles per
inch, would be in reality only half as fine as cut and would
necessitate the use of a heavier or larger yarn.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 37.</i><br />Basket Weave Design Made With the Rack.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>To make the fabric shown
in Fig. 37 pull down or remove
every other needle in the front
plate. Then pull down or remove
every other needle in the
back plate for five needles, then
leave two needles together and
remove every other needle for
five more, leave two needles together
and continue as before
until the full width of needles
in working position are as follows:
Every other needle down
out of working position in the
front plate, and every other one
down in groups of five with
two needles together between
these groups in the back plate.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>We will find by this arrangement that when we rack the
plate over one needle, every second group of five needles in the
back plate will rack across a needle of the front plate, but the
other groups will simply move between the needles in the front
plate, therefore will make a plain half cardigan stitch only,
while the other groups will make a rack stitch. If this operation
were continued in this way, racking one needle only back
and forth, we would get a fabric with vertical stripes of
alternating plain half cardigan and rack stitch. But if we
rack back and forth one needle each round for ten rounds, then
rack over the second needle and rack back and forth one
needle in this position, we will find that the groups of five
needles that were racking in the first instance are now making
the plain half cardigan stitch, and the groups that were at first
making the plain are now racking.</p>

<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 36.</i><br />Designs Made with Rack Stitch.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>An ingenious knitter can make an almost unlimited number
of designs of this character by different arrangements of his
needles and a variation of the timing of his racks. One thing
which should be remembered is that all racking should be done
on the course that tucks or holds two stitches when racking
on the half cardigan. On the full cardigan both courses are
tucked, therefore it does not matter which one is racked, only
the side of the fabric on which the rack shows is dependent
upon which course the plate is racked.</p>

<p class='c006'>The design shown in Fig. 36 at <i>a</i> is simply a zig-zag stitch
with three needles taken out of the back plate at short intervals,
giving these places a piping effect. The fabric at <i>b</i> is a plain
one-needle rack with the piping made in the same manner.</p>

  <h2 id='ch05' class='c004'>CHAPTER V <br /> <br /> <span class='sc'>The Double Lock Flat Machine—How Different Stitches are Formed</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>Our study of flat machines up to this point has dealt
entirely with the class known as the single lock machines,
or those that have but one set or pair of locks to do the
knitting. There is another very popular type, commonly
known as the double-lock machine, which is, it might be said,
in a class by itself. This machine, as the name would indicate,
has two sets or pairs of locks mounted on the same carriage,
and set as closely together as they can be and work properly.</p>

<p class='c006'>The double-lock machine has many advantages over the
single-lock type, the most important being that there can be
made upon it a two-faced fabric, that is, a fabric with each
side faced with a different yarn, either in color, quality or
both. The popular “cotton back” sweater is in this class. In
making this class of fabric it is essential that the two different
yarns, to show out on the two faces of the fabric, go into the
fabric in alternate courses. Therefore, it is obvious that it
would not be practical to make this fabric on a single lock
machine, for when a course was finished the second yarn
would be on the opposite end of the machine from the locks
and yarn carrier, and it would be necessary to put on a full
round, or two courses, in order to get back to that end to
exchange yarn carriers.</p>

<p class='c006'>The double-lock machine overcomes this difficulty by taking
both yarn carriers across, one following the other, each on a
pair of locks, each time the carriage moves across the machine.
It is evident from this that every time the carriage is moved
across the machine there are two courses put on the fabric,
instead of one as with the single-lock machine.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>Speed and Production</h3>
<p class='c005'>This point leads up to another advantage of the double-lock
machine, that is, increased production on account of putting on
two courses with each movement of the carriage across, as
against one course with the single-lock machine. The production
would not be twice as much, as might be supposed at first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>thought, for comparing two machines of the same size, the
single lock could be operated at a greater speed than the double
lock, but not approaching twice the speed. The reason for this
is that the locks of the double-lock machine must, of course, be
practically twice the length of the locks of the single-lock
machine, and inasmuch as the locks must move far enough at
each end to be clear of or past the needles, it is quite obvious
that the double-lock carriage must have a longer travel. Therefore,
it takes longer to complete one round of the carriage than
the single-lock machine, to maintain the same needle speed.</p>

<p class='c006'>This brings us to another point that may as well be disposed
of here, and that is the speed of latch needle machines. Generally
speaking, the maximum speed of a latch needle machine, either
flat or circular, is governed by the needle speed; that is, the
speed at which the cams raise and lower the needles, and the
thread velocity, which is of course dependent on the needle
speed.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>Speed of Flat Machines</h3>
<p class='c005'>As a general rule, where the machine is in good condition
and the yarn of fairly good quality, a flat machine with a
crank drive should be operated at from 100 to 125 lineal feet
per minute, and a chain drive may be operated at from 125
to 150 lineal feet per minute. The reason for this difference
between the chain drive and the crank drive is that with the
crank drive the movement of the carriage across the machine
is not uniform throughout, its movement being faster in the
center than at either end, therefore we must regulate our
speed so it will not be too high at this point. On the other
hand, the chain drive carries uniformly throughout the movement
of the carriage except for two or three inches at the ends.</p>

<p class='c006'>To explain what is meant by lineal feet per minute, let us
assume that we have a 20-inch machine, that is, there are 20
inches of needles. In this case the carriage would have to
travel about 30 inches on account of the locks having to clear
the needles at both ends, therefore a movement of the carriage
across and back, or one complete round, would cover twice 30
inches or 60 inches, or 5 feet. Now if we intend to run this
machine at a speed of 120 lineal feet per minute, we would
divide 120 feet by 5 feet, which would give us 24 rounds per
minute, the speed the machine should run.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>I do not wish to be understood as giving this as a hard and
fast rule for the speed of machines, for there are many
factors which enter into the operation of knitting machinery
which might make it desirable to vary this speed. Some of
these factors are the condition of the machine, the experience
of the operator, the character of the yarn, the class of fabric,
and sometimes the skill of the mechanic in charge of the
machines.</p>

<p class='c006'>Going back to the two-faced fabric, this must be made on
one of the two cardigans. The “cotton backs” are usually
made on the half cardigan, while the fabrics with two different
colored faces are made on the full cardigan as a rule.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 40.</i><br />Dubied System of Double Locks.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Fig. 40 shows a type of double lock used in a Dubied
machine made in Switzerland. The reader will understand
from what has gone before that this illustration shows the
locks turned upside down, that is, if they were in operation
on a machine they would be turned over with the cams close
to the needle plates. It will be noted that the fundamentals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>are the same as in the Lamb system previously described, but
the method used to change from the plain rib to the full or
half cardigan, or vice versa, is different.</p>

<p class='c006'>In making a plain rib fabric the needle butts would follow
the camway as in the Lamb system, that is, if the carriage
were being moved from left to right the needle butts would
follow the course up with cams 1<i>a</i>, 1<i>b</i> and 1<i>c</i> below, and 1, 1<i>s</i>,
8<i>s</i> and 8 above. This explanation would of course apply to all
four sets of cams. The cams 1<i>b</i>, 2<i>b</i>, 3<i>b</i> and 4<i>b</i> have studs
which project through the cam plate and there are means provided
to draw any one or all of these cams back through the
cam plate by these studs far enough so that the faces of the
cams are flush with the cam plate, and entirely out of operation.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cams 1<i>c</i>, 2<i>c</i>, 3<i>c</i> and 4<i>c</i> are made to swing on the pivots,
<i>aa</i>, and are held down on cams, 1<i>a</i> to 4<i>a</i>, in the position shown,
by springs. It should be particularly noticed that the cams
just mentioned, 1<i>b</i> to 4<i>b</i>, and 1<i>c</i> to 4<i>c</i>, are exactly alike in the
four sets of locks, but their positions are reversed in the sets
opposite. They are placed in this way in order to facilitate
the making of the cardigan stitches.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>Making Half Cardigan Stitch</h3>
<p class='c005'>In the study of what follows it should be remembered that
the illustration at Fig. 40 shows the locks bottom up, therefore
in actual operation the lower set in the illustrations would be
the back ones, and the upper set the front ones.</p>

<p class='c006'>In making the half cardigan stitch it is customary to have
the tuck or holdover stitch on the back plate; on the double-lock
machine, where we have two feeds, it is on the back feed,
and the plain course is on the locks that are leading. Therefore,
to make a half cardigan stitch with these locks we would
simply raise cams 2<i>b</i> and 3<i>b</i> up through the cam plate out of
working position.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now remembering that the cams 2<i>c</i> and 3<i>c</i> are free to swing
up and down on the pivots, <i>aa</i>, and are held down in their
present position by a small spring, it should be readily understood
that in moving the carriage from, let us say, left to
right, the butts of the needles would follow up the right side
of cam 2<i>a</i>, and on up over 2<i>c</i>, therefore would knit out on this
course. But when these butts came to the second set of locks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>they would move up the right side of cam 3<i>a</i> until they came to
the upper right hand corner of this cam, and at this point, on
account of cam 3<i>b</i> being up out of operation, they would move
across and raise up cam 3<i>c</i> and pass under it. Cam 3<i>a</i> not
being high enough to raise the needles to the point where the
stitch would drop off the latches, obviously the needles must
hold the two stitches on this side of these locks.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the return of the carriage from right to left the operation
of the needles would be reversed, that is, they would pass
up over cam 3<i>c</i> and knit out on the locks in the lead and pass
under cam 2<i>c</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>To sum up the whole operation in a few words, to make a
half cardigan stitch we must alternate with the plain rib
course and a course that tucks or holds the previous stitch, as
well as the new one on one side. This half cardigan is the
stitch used in making what is known as the “cotton back”
sweater and other such fabrics.</p>

<p class='c006'>By having one yarn carrier threaded with cotton and one
threaded with wool or worsted, as the case may be, and changing
these carriers at the end of every course so as to keep
the cotton always knitting at the cams that are leading or making
the plain stitch, the cotton alone will draw through on the
back of the fabric while the worsted or wool will practically
cover the face stitch of the cotton. This exchange of the yarn
carriers at the end of each course is done automatically by
the machine, therefore requires no attention by the operator.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>Full Cardigan Stitch</h3>
<p class='c005'>To make the full cardigan stitch the procedure would be
practically the same as explained on the single-lock machine,
as both pairs of these locks would be tucking or holding on
one side (opposite sides) on one course, and each would reverse
itself on the return course. The cams 1<i>b</i>, 2<i>b</i>, 3<i>b</i> and 4<i>b</i> would
be lifted up out of operation. When this is done the cams
1<i>c</i>, 2<i>c</i>, 3<i>c</i> and 4<i>c</i> would operate automatically to give us this
result. This is the stitch used as a rule to make the two-faced
fabrics, that is, to make the two sides of different colors.</p>

<p class='c006'>In connection with this explanation the question may arise
as to why the half cardigan stitch is used in making a fabric
with one side cotton and the other side wool or worsted, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>the full cardigan stitch used when making the two sides of
different colors. The answer to this is that the half cardigan
stitch makes the better fabric of the two for most purposes
on account of the face stitch being full and round, thereby
filling up the space between the wales. Inasmuch as the
cotton stitch on the face is very short, and the wool or worsted
quite long, and both are the same color, the cotton will show
but very little, if any. On the other hand, if two widely
divergent colors were used, the face would not show a solid
color but would have more of a salt and pepper effect.</p>

<p class='c006'>To go back to Fig. 40 it will be noted, as stated before,
that while the principle of these locks is the same as the Lamb
system previously explained, the construction is somewhat
different. The stitch cams, 1, 8, 7, 6, 3 and 4 are shaped along
the lines of a parallelogram, while all the stitch cams in the
Lamb system were triangular. Cams 3 and 4 are made this
shape to allow placing the triangular cam, 1<i>d</i>, in position to
act as a guard cam to prevent the butts of the needles from
flying up between after dropping off the ends of the stitch
cams 3 and 4. Yet it allows these stitch cams to be moved
freely up and down through the angular slot in the cam plate,
which shows at the ends, in order to make the stitch longer
or shorter as the need may be. Cams 1 and 6 are made this
shape to allow placing back of them the triangular cams 9 and
10, but these are for another purpose.</p>

<p class='c006'>It sometimes happens that it is desirable to make a fabric
with the stitch so short that it would not cast the old stitch
off over the end of the needles with all the cams set high
enough to make this short stitch. When this is the case, cams
1 and 6 only would be moved up to a point where they would
not draw the new stitch through the previous one on their
respective courses, therefore would not use any yarn, while
the opposite cams 2 and 5 would draw a full stitch.</p>

<p class='c006'>After the needles had passed these cams (2 and 5) the
cams 9 and 10 on their respective courses, having been set
down to the proper position, would draw the needles in this
plate down to the point where the old stitch would cast off,
thereby completing that stitch without undue strain on the
yarn on account of the needles on the opposite side being free
to raise far enough to prevent it. Cam 11 acts as a guard
cam for 7 and 8 and also is used on a short stitch to cast off
for these two cams, the same as 9 and 10 cast off for 1 and 6.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>Yarn Carrier for Plating</h3>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Fig. 41 shows a yarn carrier
used for plating on a flat machine.
By plating is meant
where two threads of different
quality, say worsted and cotton,
are used in the same course, and
the worsted is laid in the fabric
so as to show on the outside and
the cotton is in the middle. To
do this the worsted yarn, <i>d</i>, <i>d</i>,
would pass through the center
hole, <i>b</i>, and the yarn <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, passing
through the crescent-shaped
hole, <i>a</i>, would be the cotton. It
will be noted that the angular
draw of the yarn from the
bottom of the guide into the
needles will always keep the
yarns in the positions shown.
When the end of the course is reached, and the movement of
the carriage is reversed, the cotton yarn <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, will swing around
to the opposite end of the crescent-shaped hole, <i>a</i>, and in this
way will always be in the same relative position to the worsted
yarn <i>d</i>.</p>

  <h2 id='ch06' class='c004'>CHAPTER VI <br /> <br /> <span class='sc'>Fashioned Goods</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_8 c012'><span class='sc'>Fashioned</span> goods are garments which, while being knit on
the machine, are made the proper shape to fit the wearer.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the garment to be fashioned is a sweater, the fashioning
or shaping to be done is the sleeve, the neck opening, the collar,
and at times in the better class of sweaters, the arm holes are
narrowed back from the lower part to the shoulder in order to
shorten the shoulder length, thereby insuring a better fit. When
making underwear not only the sleeves have to be shaped but
the legs of the drawers are shaped also. In the ladies’ high
class fashioned underwear and tights the bust and hips are
shaped. Much of this class of work, with the exception of
hosiery, is made on the hand machines and involves much more
labor, time and skill, than where the work is knit in a straight
piece and made the proper shape by other means after being
taken off the machine.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are three advantages in fashioning the garments in
the knitting operation. First, there is a saving in material
as there is no material cut off in order to get the shape. This
saving, however, would pay but a small part of the extra labor
involved. Second, fashioned goods make up into better looking
and as a rule better fitting garments than cut goods. Third,
on account of the edges being selvage, not cut and raw, it is
possible to join two edges so the place of joining will look much
like a wale in the fabric, thereby avoiding the unsightly seams
of the cut garment.</p>

<p class='c006'>In fashioning of this character it is customary to set the
machine up and start at the widest part of the garment, if
possible, so that in getting the required shape the fabric will
be made narrower instead of wider, though this is not essential,
as it is practical to widen the fabric as well as to make it
narrower.</p>

<p class='c005'>The letter <i>a</i> in Fig. 42 shows the instrument used for narrowing
by hand. It is called a decker or narrowing comb. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>will be noted that it consists of long slim points clamped in a
handle, with an eye in the free end of each point. There may
be any desired number of points
clamped in the handle, the limit being
only the width of the clamp, but the
usual number for this work is from
three to five. These points must be set
at a distance from one another to
correspond to the cut of the machine
on which they are to be used; that is,
if the needle plates are cut for six
needles to one inch the spacing of the
decker points must be the same. I
might add that these deckers are sometimes
made by stamping the whole
decker, points and all, out of sheet
steel, and sometimes by soldering the
round points on to a handle.</p>

<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 43.</i><br />Set Up Comb.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Perhaps the best way to explain the use of this decker is
to give directions for making a sleeve. First we must have a
set up comb, shown in Fig. 43, the use of which will be understood
as we proceed. Then we must have weights with which
to hold the work down on the needles, for, as stated before,
in the operation of knitting there must always be means provided
to pull the fabric onto and away from the needles. These
weights are simply a stand made from a short iron rod about
three-sixteenths inch in diameter and about seven to eight
inches long, with a hook turned on one end, a small round
iron disc attached to the other, and a number of round iron
weights slotted to the center to allow the operator to slip
them on or off the stand to secure the desired pull. In fact,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>the stand and weights are a duplicate of the stand and weights
we see hanging on the end of the beam of a common platform
scale.</p>

<p class='c006'>To make the sleeve we would put up the required number
of needles for the full width of the sleeve, let us say 100, and
set the locks for half cardigan stitch. We would then draw
the yarn through the yarn guide and down through the throat
between the needle plates. Then we would move the carriage
across the machine to the opposite side, and we should find that
each needle had caught the yarn and drawn it back and forth
across the throat. We would now take our set up comb,
illustrated in Fig. 43, and push the points which project at
the top up through the throat, from underneath, until the
upper ends are above the yarn, which has been drawn back
and forth across the throat, after which we push the wire,
shown just above the comb, through the eyes in the end of
the points, as indicated by the dotted line. Now we can pull
the comb down on to the yarn and the wire will rest on it.
We then hang a weight in the center hole at the bottom and
are ready to proceed with the knitting.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>Operation of Narrowing</h3>
<p class='c005'>The first thing we would do after hanging on our weights
would be to rack over one needle to give that end of the sleeve
a smooth selvage finish. We would now put on five rounds,
after which we would begin to narrow. Stopping the carriage
on the left side of the machine, we would take the decker and
place the hooks of the three end needles, in the back plate on
the right, in the eyes of the three points of the decker, draw
the needles up until the stitch dropped down below the latch,
then push them down to their first position. We find that the
stitches have dropped off over the end and free of the needle
on to our decker. We now carry the stitches in toward the
center one needle, hook on to these three needles and pull them
up through the stitches, being careful not to pull them up so
far that the stitches will drop down below the latches. After
this has been done we have the end needle without a stitch
and therefore pull it down where it is out of operation.</p>

<p class='c006'>We go through this same performance on the front needle
plate, right side, then move the carriage over to the right and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>do the same with the left side. It is obvious that when we
have finished we shall have put four needles out of operation,
or what would count as two in the width of the garment. We
would repeat this after every five rounds for twenty-five
rounds, so at this point our sleeve would be ten needles narrower
than when we started, although we would have put out of
operation twenty needles in narrowing. It is customary to
reckon only with the needles of one plate, as the wales of one
side only are counted in the width of a rib fabric.</p>

<p class='c006'>Shaping a garment in this manner leaves a selvage edge for
joining, consequently when the garment is finished the seams,
when properly put together, are small with an appearance much
like a wale in the fabric. They also have the same stretch or
elasticity as the fabric.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 44.</i><br />Outline of Fashioned Sleeve.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Fig. 44 is an outline of approximately
the shape the sleeve
should be when finished and
shows the direction of the wales
and the places where the ones
doubled up terminate. This is
shown on one side and edge
only, although the other side
and edge would be the same.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is understood, of course, that
the sleeve is shown opened up
flat, and in being put on a
garment would be doubled over
and the edges joined on the
underside of the arm. To reduce
the size from the forearm
to the wrist or cuff it is usual,
in sweaters, to depend on the
change to the plain rib stitch,
for as explained previously the
plain rib will come out much
narrower than the half or full
cardigan with the same number of needles and the same yarn.
In underwear and theatrical tights it is customary to fashion
down the forearm to the cuff.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many knitters consider it good practice to reverse this
formula in fashioning; that is, to start at the cuff in order to
have the rack stitch on the end of the cuff to save the hand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>finishing. In this event the narrowing operation as described
would be reversed, or a widening operation.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is done by pulling up the three end needles and pushing
them down until the stitches drop off on to the decker, as in
narrowing, but instead of setting these stitches in towards the
center we would push up another needle and set them out one.
This would leave the fourth needle without a stitch, so we
would pick up the previous stitch, which had been cast off of
what is now the fifth needle and raise it up and hook it over
the fourth. This is done with one point of the decker. After
having done this on both plates and on both sides of the
sleeve, while we would have pushed four needles up into
operation, we would have widened only two.</p>

<p class='c006'>Where it is not considered an advantage to have the widening
stitches show, this operation may be expedited quite a
little by using the hook shown at <i>b</i> in Fig. 42, which is a
convenient size to handle, about one-eighth inch in diameter by
6 inches long. By this method we push up into operation the
new needle and simply catch with the hook the previous stitch
cast off of the end needle and hook it on to the new needle on
the four corners as before described. It is best to do this one
needle at a time with a course between, taking the one on the
plate that contains the inside needle.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_8 c012'>
<span class='sc'>The</span> term “automatic” as applied to this class of machine
means that all the changes are made automatically, as
from plain stitch to half cardigan or full cardigan, or vice
versa, changing colors to make striped work, making the rack
stitch and back to plain rib, changing from rib to tubular or
jersey stitch, making the French rack, etc. All these changes
may be made at any predetermined place in the work without
any attention from the operator. The machines discussed up
to this point may be presumed to have been hand machines,
that is, operated by manual power. Therefore, all changes
of the stitch, yarn, racking, etc., may be done to advantage at
the proper time and place by the operator as the machine
requires his whole attention anyway.</p>

<p class='c006'>A prerequisite of an automatic machine is the operating
of the machine by other than manual power, therefore automatic
machines are first of all what are called power machines.
This does not imply by any means that all power machines
are automatic, but rather that all automatic machines are
power machines.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 45.</i><br />Dubied Automatic Single Lock Machine.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Fig. 45 shows an automatic single-lock machine built by
Dubied &amp; Co. in Switzerland, designated as Type VD, which is
a very good example of the automatic machine. It is operated
by the belt <i>A</i>, Fig. 46, which runs it by a pulley of the clutch
type which is located back of the machine. The proper movement
is conveyed to the carriage through a pair of sprockets
and chain as shown in Fig. 46, at <i>m</i>. The carriage is connected
to the driving chain at point <i>m</i>, by the connection rod <i>n</i>,
which obviously must follow the chain back and forth around
the sprockets. This arrangement gives the carriage a uniform
movement during the time it is operating the needles and is
generally conceded as superior to the crank system of driving.</p>

<p class='c006'>The letter <i>G</i>, Fig. 45, indicates the lever for throwing in
the clutch to start the machine, and <i>F</i> is the crank for turning
the machine by hand. This crank does not turn when the
machine is run by power but hangs in the position shown.
The letter <i>S</i> shows the main or controlling chain and 1 and 2
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>indicate the racking chains. These will be taken up in more
detail later. Letter <i>B</i> indicates an ingenious counter arrangement
for counting the rounds, which permits the use of very
short chains and will be explained in due course. <i>H</i> and <i>K</i> are
yarn carriers, of which there are five altogether. The others
are on the back and cannot be seen plainly. <i>T</i> is the yoke or
bridge which holds the two sides of the carriage together.
There is no physical connection between the two sides of the
carriage at the point where the locks are attached, but the
connection is made through extensions which can be seen,
and through this yoke.</p>

<p class='c006'>On these machines the fabric is not held down by weights,
hanging thereon, as in the hand machines, but by what is
called a take-up roller which has means provided for adjustment
to keep the desired strain on the fabric at all times. The
weights which are in plain view are to hold the fabric up to
and in close contact with the take-up roller through a frame
with a small roller on the fabric side of the frame and the
weights on the outside, which work on the lever and fulcrum
principle.</p>

<p class='c006'>An automatic machine must have a pattern chain of some
kind or character to operate its automatic functions. Means
provided which will be explained in what follows cause the
desired change to be made at the proper time and place. The
machine under discussion has a main or controlling chain
made up from wire links which may be taken out or added to
at will, each link measuring about 6 inches crosswise of the
chain and about one-half inch lengthwise of the chain. This
chain is carried by a sprocket roller at the top and is held
down on this roller by its own weight, though there are guards
over each end to keep it from jumping off in case of emergency.
This sprocket roller is turned the distance of one full link
by the carriage depressing the lever <i>J</i>, and through this medium
acting on the rocker shaft <i>I</i> (Fig. 45) which extends the
length of the machine to the sprocket roller. The latter is in
turn moved the distance of one link by a pawl and ratchet.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i058.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 46.</i><br />Automatic Mechanism, Dubied Machine.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c006'>In Fig. 46 we have a view of this main chain at <i>S</i>, with
the levers on which it acts shown at <i>a</i> to <i>h</i>. These levers
swing on a small shaft, at the point where they appear to end,
near the center of the machine. Instead of ending there, each
has an extension on the other side of this shaft which extends
at an angle and reaches quite close to the chain. These levers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>though only about three-eighths of an inch wide, are arranged
so the angular extensions underneath come in line laterally
with each other and crosswise of the chain, or lengthwise of
the machine, and they, together with the space between, cover
practically the whole width of the chain. These levers swing
freely crosswise of the machine, but are fixed lengthwise,
therefore the positions of the upper ends can be very easily
moved toward the front or back of the machine, but are
stationary in the direction in which the carriage moves.</p>

<p class='c006'>Keeping this in our mind, we will now refer to the main
chain shown in Fig. 46 at <i>S</i>. It will be noted that there are a
number of studs affixed to the chain which project up above
the chain proper. These studs may be put on at any desired
spot and taken off at will. It is quite obvious that if we fix
a stud on this chain at a spot in line with one of the levers, let
us say at lever <i>a</i>, when the chain has moved forward to the
point where this stud comes under the angular extension of
the lever the position of the top of the lever would be changed.
And this new position would be fixed until the carriage has
been moved to the other end of the machine and turned the
chain one more link. Then the lower end of the lever will
drop off the stud and be returned to its former position by a
spring.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is essential that the reader get these explanations of
the different parts and their functions well fixed in his mind
in order to understand intelligently the relation of one to
the other.</p>

<p class='c006'>Fig. 47 is a drawing of the cams and cam plates, and Fig. 48
shows the top of the carriage with the cams or locks mounted
underneath. In the Dubied machine this part of the carriage
on which the locks are fixed is detachable, and either side may
be taken off separately, which arrangement is very convenient
at times. At the left of Fig. 48 will be seen several slides,
designated by small letters, which extend through the locks at
different points between the cam plate and the carriage proper,
and some on the top of the carriage. These are the essence of
the automatic control of the stitch forming mechanism. This
principle is followed in all automatic machines of this type,
although the different builders vary in the details of construction
and in the methods of moving these slides, as well as the
manner of operating on the cams and yarn carriers.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>These slides make the proper cam or yarn guide changes
by being pushed in or pulled out, as the case may be, and this
is done by the levers indicated by the letters <i>a</i> to <i>i</i>, Fig. 46.
Each slide is provided with a flat spot or shoulder, as indicated
at <i>m</i> and <i>o</i>, Fig. 48, which pushes them in upon coming in
contact with the proper lever as the carriage reaches the
extreme left end and is clear of the needles. In order to have
these slides moved in just the proper distance there are projections
from the carriage underneath the slides with beveled ends,
part of which may be seen in Fig. 48 at <i>k</i> and <i>i</i>, which push
the levers off the before-mentioned shoulders and release the
slides at just the proper time. To explain the drawing out
of these slides, it will be noted that each slide has an enlarged
part or head and all have at least one right angled shoulder
on the inside of the head; some have two.</p>

<p class='c006'>It will also be noted that each one has under it a guard
or extension from the carriage, which is fixed to the carriage
and is stationary, as <i>e</i> and <i>p</i>. This extension also has an
enlarged part or head on the outer end, but it is different from
the heads on the levers in one respect, this head has sloping
shoulders on both ends instead of the right angled shoulders
that are on the inside head of the slides. Where a fixed guard
or extension has a sloping shoulder on both sides (not ends)
they will be found to be at different distances from the carriage.</p>

<p class='c006'>The right angled shouldered heads on the slides are made
in this way so that when the proper lever (Fig. 46) is placed
in its path, which is done by the studs attached to the main
chain <i>S</i>, it will slide over the head and drop in back of the
shoulder as the carriage moves to the left, and when the
carriage moves to the right the lever catches on the shoulder
and draws it out until the lever is released by being pushed
out by the sloping shoulder of the extension underneath. When
the fixed extension has a sloping shoulder on both sides at
different distances from the carriage proper it will be found
that the slide also has a right angled shoulder on both sides.
This indicates that this slide may be moved to any one of three
different positions, therefore has a choice of three different
functions it may perform in the automatic changes.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>Changing Stitch</h3>
</div>
<p class='c005'>To make the changes from plain rib to half or full cardigan,
or to plain jersey, etc., the slides have inclined planes under
the cam plates and these engage notches or pins on studs
extending through from the cams and by this means raise the
cams up into the cam plate out of action, or let them down
into action as the case may be. The illustration, Fig. 47, shows
them all down in the proper position to make the plain rib
or cuff stitch.</p>

<p class='c006'>To change to half cardigan stitch it would be necessary to
raise cam 3<i>b</i> up out of operation, which is done by slide <i>n</i>. Fig.
48, which in turn is moved to the proper position to accomplish
this by the lever <i>h</i>, Fig. 46. This slide has three different
positions, therefore three different functions to perform in
the automatic changes, which are accomplished as follows: To
make a half cardigan stitch a low stud (there are three heights,
low, medium and high) should be placed so it will come under
lever <i>h</i>. When this takes place the top end of this lever is
moved to the position where it would engage the upper
shoulder of slide <i>n</i>, and on the return of the carriage it would
draw this slide out to its farthest point, or until it is pushed
off the shoulder by the taper on that side of the guard or
extension <i>p</i>. When the slide is moved to this position it raises
up and holds out of operation cam 3<i>b</i>, thus causing the machine
to make the half cardigan stitch. This should be readily
understood from what has gone before.</p>

<p class='c006'>To change to plain rib stitch place a medium stud under
the same lever (<i>h</i>) and its top position will be changed to
where it will push the slide clear in as the carriage moves to
the left. On the return movement the lever will engage the
shoulder on the opposite side and draw it out until released by
the guard as before. This releases cam 3<i>b</i>, which drops down
into working position. The fact that the sloping shoulders on
each side of the stationary guards are at different distances
from the carriage causes this slide, <i>n</i>, to be left in different
positions according to which side the lever <i>h</i> engages it.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the third change, which makes the French rack or false
knop stitches, it is necessary to raise up out of operation the
cams 3<i>b</i> and 3<i>c</i>. To do this a high stud should be placed to
come under the same lever (<i>h</i>), which would then be moved
to a position where it would come in contact with the shoulder <i>v</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>(which is a part of the slide <i>n</i>) and would push the slide in
until disengaged by another sloping guard which cannot be
seen. When the lever drops back on to the chain without any
studs under it it is clear of all slides; therefore will make no
changes. The other slides are moved in the same way as the
one just explained, but each one has the part, which make?
the changes, constructed in such a manner that it will operate
that particular member of the locks for which it is intended.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>Changing the Yarn Carriers</h3>
<p class='c005'>There is one other change that is made by these levers and
slides besides the changes in the stitch, and that is changing
the yarn carriers to make stripes of different colors. This is
done, not by changing the yarn in the yarn carriers as one
might imagine, but by providing a carrier for each yarn needed
and then changing the carriers. These carriers are shown at
letter <i>k</i>, in Fig. 46. They are not fixed to the carriage but are
attached to a block which slides back and forth on ways or
gibs which are shown at 1, 2, 3 and 4, and reach the length
of the machine. The gibs are undercut on a bevel on both
edges and the block is undercut in the same way, so they
dovetail together to keep the block from lifting off, yet are
free to slide back and forth on the gib. These blocks have a
depression or are cut out on the upper edge with a square
shoulder at each end of the cut out, and the carrier is moved
back and forth by a plunger which is attached to the carriage
and engages these shoulders.</p>

<p class='c006'>In Fig. 47, at letter <i>x</i>, are shown the plungers, and Fig. 48,
letter <i>x</i>, shows them placed in the block and attached to the
carriage. These plungers are set to pick up the desired yarn
carrier by the slide, <i>i</i>, on the front, and slide, <i>z</i>, on the back.
(Fig. 48.)</p>
<h3 class='c013'>Racking Chains</h3>
<p class='c005'>We will leave the slides and levers for the present and
give our attention to the two racking chains shown in Fig.
49 at figures 1 and 2. Inasmuch as the rack stitch is made
by a part of the machine entirely separate and distinct from
the locks and carriage, that is, the needle plate, obviously it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>is necessary to arrange means other than the levers and
slides on the top of the machine to do this automatically. The
mechanism used to do the actual racking is illustrated in Fig.
32. The illustration is accompanied by an explanation of the
required movements. This racking cam may be seen in Fig.
49 at letter <i>R</i>. Having in mind the former explanation it is
evident that to control the racking it is necessary to control
the pawls only which actuate the ratchet. This is done by
the racking chains shown in Fig. 49. They of themselves do
no actual racking, but simply put the pawls into action or out
of action, as the case may be, at the proper time. These chains
hang on a sprocket roller and are moved two links at each
round of the machine by the same means as the main chain,
and are started and stopped automatically by studs on the
main chain at any predetermined time. There are also two
levers over the top of each, and it is by means of these levers
that they control the pawls which actuate the racking cam
ratchet through small rocker shafts.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i065.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 49.</i><br />Racking Chains and Cam, Dubied Automatic Single Lock Machine.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It will be noted that the chains have studs attached, similar
to the main chain, which are staggered or attached alternately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>near both sides of the chain. As these studs pass under and
raise a lever at the top of the chain they cause a pawl to act
on the racking cam ratchet, thereby making one rack.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the carriage makes the next round the chain would
have moved forward so the lever just mentioned would have
dropped off its stud and the stud on the other side of the chain
would move up to and under the second lever, which would
cause the other pawl to act in the opposite way and therefore
would rack the plate back to its starting point. If two or
more racks in the same direction are desired, it would only
be necessary to put two or more studs in line on the same
side, but remembering that where this is done it is imperative
that later the same number be placed on the other side so as
to return the racking plate to its original position.</p>

<p class='c006'>Both of these chains do the same work and in the same
manner, and either one may be selected to do the racking at
any time or place, but both should not and cannot be operated
at the same time for there is a very ingenious arrangement
which will stop the one automatically, if working, immediately
when the other one starts.</p>

<p class='c006'>The reason for providing two chains instead of one is to
enable the operator to make two different kinds of rack in
one garment by setting the studs on one chain for let us say
a one-needle rack, and on the other for a two-needle rack. This
arrangement permits the use of very short chains, as the
racked pattern may repeat itself on the chain any number of
times, where if a single chain were used it would be necessary
to have a chain long enough to have a stud for each time the
plate racked, when two patterns are required, and this would
necessitate the use of a very long chain at times.</p>

<p class='c006'>Some few years ago, when automatic machines were first
brought out, all automatic functions were operated from a
single chain. This meant the use of very long and unwieldy
chains many times, as it was necessary to have a link in the
chain for each round. It was soon realized that by stopping
the chain during the time the machine was making one kind
of fabric without a change, which on most work is by far the
greater part, and operating it only when needed, not only much
time and material in making up the chain would be saved, but
also much annoyance and trouble in providing means to keep
the chain from getting twisted or out of place while running
would be eliminated.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>Control of Automatic Changes</h3>
</div>
<p class='c005'>Most of the builders have devised means to do this and one
of the best methods is the cylinder or drum idea devised by
Dubied &amp; Co., which is shown in Fig. 50. To more easily
master the explanation of how this cylinder operates, it should
be understood that its only function is to count the rounds and
start the main chain at the proper point, the chain stopping
itself after having caused the automatic changes necessary at
that point.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i067.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 50.</i><br />Counting Drum for Short Chain Arrangement, Dubied Machines.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The device consists of a cylinder about 10 to 12 inches long
by about 6 inches in diameter, around which are cut two spiral
grooves, the larger of which is used to attach stops and the
smaller to act as a guide for the fingers <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>, which extend
down into and run in the narrow groove and carry the whole
block, including the forks <i>k</i> and <i>l</i>, forward or backward
on the rods <i>g</i> and <i>h</i>, according to which way the cylinder is
turning.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>The cylinder is divided in its circumference by the lines
into 1,000 divisions, and is turned the distance of one division
each round of the machine by means of the roller on the lug <i>o</i>,
which raises the lever <i>a</i>, which in its turn raises the pawl <i>c</i>, and
its duplicate on the back, which cannot be seen. It can very
easily be noted how the pawl <i>c</i> engages the outside ratchet and
on being raised it would obviously turn the drum one tooth
of the ratchet wheel. The back pawl operates on the center
ratchet wheel and inasmuch as this ratchet wheel is cut the
opposite way from the outside one, and the pawl is on the
opposite side, it is plain that when the back pawl is in operation
the cylinder will turn backward.</p>

<p class='c006'>Both pawls raise each time the lever is raised, but only one
at a time can engage the ratchets and the one which engages
is governed by the stops <i>A</i> or <i>E</i> on the cylinder. This is done
by two guards, one of which may be seen at <i>d</i>, while the other
would be between the back pawl and its ratchet, therefore this
back pawl could not operate.</p>

<p class='c006'>These guards are mounted on a triangular or three-cornered
frame which is pivoted at the center on the cylinder shaft with
the guards mounted on the two lower corners, while the
third corner is engaged by the lever <i>n</i>, which in turn is secured
to the rod <i>h</i>. Now it is plain that if the bottom or base of this
triangle is moved forward or toward the machine, the front
guard would move under and disengage the front pawl while
the back guard would move down and free the back pawl and
allow it to operate on its ratchet wheel.</p>

<p class='c006'>Keeping this triangular arrangement in mind we will turn
our attention to the block, of which the fingers <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>, and
the forks <i>k</i> and <i>l</i>, form a part. As noted before there are
three fingers extending down to the cylinder from the block,
two of which (<i>i</i> and <i>j</i>) reach down to but do not touch the
cylinder, while the third one, which is between these two,
engages in the smaller of the two grooves.</p>

<p class='c006'>The block is constructed so it must move lengthwise of
the rod as one piece, but each part is free to move laterally
independent of another. The block is not fixed in any manner
to the top rod and the only positive connection it has with
the lower rod <i>h</i> is with a key in the center finger which
engages in a keyway which is cut the full length of the rod. It
should now be clear to the reader that so long as there is no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>obstruction placed in the path of the center finger it will simply
follow the small groove and gradually move over toward the
right (if the front pawl is operating and the top of the cylinder
is turning away from you) until it comes to the Stop, <i>E</i>, which
it will be noted lies across its path.</p>

<p class='c006'>On account of the key in this center finger engaging the
keyway in the rod <i>h</i>, it naturally follows that when the finger
comes up to the stop <i>E</i>, the next movement of the cylinder will
swing it away from you and this turn of the rod <i>h</i>, will swing
the lever <i>n</i>, and through this will swing the triangle on which
the guards <i>d</i>, are mounted, bringing the front guard <i>d</i> up
under the front pawl and at the same time will free the back
pawl on the center ratchet, thereby reversing the movement of
the cylinder.</p>

<p class='c006'>Upon the return of the block to its starting point at the
left end of the cylinder, its direction of movement is again
reversed in the same way by the stop <i>A</i>. Stop <i>A</i> is set at
division <i>O</i> and is never moved, but stop <i>E</i> may be placed at any
number of the divisions corresponding to the number of rounds
in the garment. This point will be taken up again further
along.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now to give our attention to the side fingers <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>. These
are constructed so that the left one, or <i>i</i>, will swing freely
toward you but an attempt to swing it away from you will
engage the fork <i>k</i>, which by contact would swing the rod <i>g</i>,
which through the connection <i>f</i> would raise the lever <i>e</i>, and
this by a pull on the cord <i>m</i> would start the main chain in
motion. The right finger <i>j</i> works in precisely the same manner,
only that it swings freely when moved away from you and
starts the main chain in motion when moved toward you, by
contact of the fork <i>l</i> with rod <i>g</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>With the foregoing in mind it should hardly be necessary
to explain that the stops <i>C</i> and <i>D</i> are for the purpose of putting
the main chain in motion by coming in contact with the fingers
<i>i</i> or <i>j</i>; <i>C</i> to operate when the cylinder is turning the top away
from you by tripping finger <i>i</i>, and <i>D</i> when it turns toward you
by tripping finger <i>j</i>. It will be noted that the stops <i>A</i> and <i>E</i>
have short extensions which extend forward along the side of
the small groove. These cause the side fingers, <i>i</i> or <i>j</i>, to start
the main chain at the same time that the direction of the movement
of the cylinder changes. If for any reason this is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>desired, a stop like <i>B</i> may be used instead of these, and then the
cylinder will reverse without starting the main chain.</p>

<p class='c006'>Going back to the setting of stop <i>E</i>, where the garment to
be made has less than 1,000 rounds, it is customary to set
this stop as well as the intermediate stops, like <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>, to
make a complete garment on its forward movement and a
second one on its return. But if the garment should have
more than 1,000 rounds, let us say 1,500, then stop <i>E</i> would
be set on division 750 and the small stops like <i>C</i>, which are
for tripping the finger <i>i</i>, would be placed at the proper place
to start the main chain for the automatic changes in the first
half of the garment. The stops like <i>D</i>, which are for tripping
the finger <i>j</i>, would do the same for the last half of the garment.</p>

<p class='c006'>If there is no change to be made in the middle of the
garment the knitter may avoid it by either one of two means;
either by using a stop like <i>B</i>, which will reverse the movement
of the cylinder without starting the main chain, or by using
a stop like <i>E</i>, which starts the main chain at the same time
it reverses the movement of the cylinder, but in this event
he must put in the main chain two extra links with a stud
attached for stopping the chain immediately after starting
without acting upon any of its automatic mechanism.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the fabric being made does not require the use of the
cylinder all that it is necessary to do to stop it is to raise up
the lever <i>a</i>, and draw the roller <i>b</i> out against the head of
its stud.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>Control of Yarn</h3>
<p class='c005'>Up to this point the yarn guides and carriers have been
mentioned only incidentally so we will now take them up in
more detail. Where there is only one thread and guide on a
machine it is a very simple matter to control it but in the
modern full automatic machines, where there are several
threads and guides, and they must be arranged so that any one
on a single lock machine, or any two on a double lock, may
be selected at will, it becomes more of a problem. There is
another point that must be taken into consideration in connection
with this. That is, in the automatic machines the
carriage must travel the full length of the machine but much
of the fabric made on these machines does not take the whole
width. Therefore if the yarn carrier was carried the full
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>length with the locks there would be at the end of each course
a considerable length of yarn, reaching from the edge of the
fabric to the yarn carrier, which it would be very difficult, if
not impossible, to draw back through the yarn guide. There
must be no slack yarn between the edge of the fabric and the
yarn guide when starting to knit across on a course.</p>

<p class='c006'>To obviate these difficulties the yarn carriers are attached
to blocks which in turn are mounted on ways or bars which
reach the full length of the machine and may be seen in Fig. 46,
and are indicated by the figures 1, 2, 3 and 4 in white. This
has been explained in part before, together with the manner
of operating the carriers with plungers, but I wish to call
the reader’s attention to it again as it has a direct connection
with what follows.</p>

<p class='c006'>To prevent the yarn carrier from following the locks to
the end of their travel, and thereby accumulating yarn between
the guide and the edge of the fabric, there is a stop placed at
each end of the fabric to stop the carrier at the proper point.
One of these stops may be seen in Fig. 49, at <i>Q</i>. This may be
placed in any desired spot and is held in place by a pin which
engages in one of the holes in the way or bar, which holes
may be plainly seen.</p>

<p class='c006'>This stop consists of a base or block which slides on to the
way on the dovetail principle. On the top edge of this base
there is a thin strip about 4 inches long by about one-half inch
wide, which is beveled down from the top to the bottom edge
on both ends. When the carriage with the yarn carrier
approaches this stop the carrier comes just under this top
strip and the point of the strip comes just under the end of
the plunger <i>X</i>, Fig. 48, also Fig. 52, which as explained before
moves the yarn carrier. As the carriage moves farther along,
the plunger slides up the incline or bevel of the strip and is
raised out of engagement with the shoulder on the yarn carrier
block, and the carrier stops while the carriage completes the
length of its travel.</p>

<p class='c006'>Upon the return of the carriage the plunger will slide over
the strip on the stop, drop into the opening of the yarn carrier
block, and engage the opposite shoulder and take the yarn
carrier back with it on the return course, where it will be
released on the other side in the same manner as just explained.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>Yarn Take-Up Spring</h3>
</div>
<p class='c005'>No matter how close to the edge of the fabric the yarn
guide may be stopped, unless the yarn is kept taut the selvage
will not be perfect, therefore a very insignificant appearing
but quite important adjunct called the yarn take-up spring is
provided to do this. There is one provided for each yarn guide
and their position in relation to the machine may be seen at
the top of the yarn stand in Fig. 45, while one is shown in
detail in Fig. 51. The spring is a coil spring turned around
the stud, <i>f</i>, and attached at the inner end. The outer end is a
part of this spring straightened out as at <i>b</i>, with an eye turned
in the end at <i>d</i>.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i072.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 51.</i><br />Yarn Stand and Take Up Spring.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>By turning the top of the stud <i>f</i> away from you it will put
more pull or tension on the spring, and by turning toward
you less. The yarn is drawn from the bobbin, <i>e</i>, through an
eye directly over the bobbin, then through a hole in the tension
stud at <i>a</i>, then through an eye of the spring, then down through
another eye in the stand at <i>g</i>, and directly to the yarn guide of
the machine. The tension <i>a</i> prevents the spring from drawing
any yarn from the bobbin, therefore it will always draw
the slack yarn from the yarn guide and keep it taut at all times.
There must be a take-up spring for each thread in use and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>that means that there are sometimes as many as eight or
ten on one stand.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have had a drawing of the double lock in Fig. 40, showing
the cam side with an explanation of how it works and its
advantages, so now we will show only the top carriage side
in Fig. 52, with its appurtenances for the automatic changes.
Bear in mind that when slides or plungers are mentioned in
the following explanation reference is made to Fig. 52, and
when cams are mentioned reference is had to Fig. 40.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>Stitch Changes</h3>
<div  class='figcenter id003'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 52.</i><br />Top Side of Carriage Directly Over Locks, Dubied Automatic<br />Double Lock Machine.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Slide <i>a</i> operates on cams 1<i>b</i> and 4<i>b</i> to change from plain
to cardigan, or vice versa, and is used in making the full
cardigan stitch. Slide <i>b</i> and <i>g</i>, working in conjunction with
<i>d</i> and <i>e</i>, are for changing the length of stitch, which will be
explained more fully later. Slides <i>c</i> and <i>f</i> are for changing the
yarn carriers to change colors. The exchange of carriers at
the end of each course in order to keep the cotton carrier
feeding into the cams that are leading (where cotton and
worsted or wool is used) is another matter and should not be
confused with this. Slide <i>h</i> operates on cams 2<i>b</i> and 3<i>b</i> to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>change from plain to half cardigan, or vice versa, also on these
cams together with cams 2<i>c</i> and 3<i>c</i> to make the French rack
or false knop. Slides <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> operate cams 1<i>a</i>, 2<i>a</i>, 3<i>a</i> and 4<i>a</i>
to make tubular work, or to be more explicit, they raise one
pair of these cams up out of operation while the other pair knit
only on one side alternately and in this way knit jersey fabric
in tubular form.</p>

<p class='c006'>To go back to slides <i>b</i> and <i>g</i>, in order to understand this
explanation it will be necessary to return again to Fig. 40.
What are called the stitch cams, or cams 1 to 10, are attached
to the cam plates through elongated slots, the ends of which
may be seen at the top and bottom of the cams. The cams,
though attached to the plate, may be easily moved lengthwise
of these slots. On the under side of the plate is a coil spring
with one end attached to a stud in the cams, while the other
end is attached to the bottom edge of the plate. These springs
will always draw the cams to the lowest end of the slots if
nothing is placed in the way. Bear in mind that the bottom
of the lower plate is the lower edge and the bottom of the
top plate is the top edge, in the drawing.</p>

<p class='c006'>To change the length of the stitch it is necessary to raise
or lower these cams. To draw a longer stitch they would be
moved toward the bottom of the plate and for a shorter one
toward the top. Now it is clear that in order to change the
length of the stitch automatically it is only necessary to provide
stops of the proper height for them to rest on when pulled
down by the before-mentioned springs. The cam studs to
which the springs are attached are long enough to reach up
through the carriage proper and may be seen resting on the
end of the pins II, Fig. 52.</p>

<p class='c006'>The reader of a mechanical turn of mind should be able to
grasp the modus operandi of the automatic changing of the
length of the stitch from the explanation up to this point, but
to continue we will refer again to the pins indicated by the
Roman numerals I, II, and III, Fig. 52.</p>

<p class='c006'>It will be noted that there are a set of three of these pins
for each stitch or draw cam, therefore the knitter may change
to any one of three different lengths of stitch at his option by
raising or lowering these pins. The pins must of course be set
individually at the proper height, each one for its own length
of stitch, before starting the machine.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Inasmuch as all the pins on the front side are attached to
one slide, and the pins on the back are attached to another, all
that it is necessary to do to change the length of the stitch is
to change the pins on which the before-mentioned cam studs
rest, they being held down on the pins by the coil spring
between the carriage proper and the cam plate. This is done
with slides <i>b</i> and <i>g</i>, in conjunction with slides <i>e</i> and <i>d</i>, which
raise the cams and studs up so they will not catch between the
pins while the change is being made. In the meantime slides
<i>b</i> and <i>g</i> move the desired pins to the position where the studs
can drop on them when the slides <i>e</i> and <i>d</i> are returned to their
running position, which position allows studs to drop on their
respective pins, with the exception of the pair of cams at the
extreme right, which are held up for one course.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is another ingenious and practical arrangement which
deserves an explanation, but this leads us to another point
which should be gone into first. That is, when the cams are
changed to make a short stitch after having made a long one,
the holding up of the right pair of stitch cams for one course
is of no benefit. But in changing from a short stitch to a
long one, inasmuch as the right pair of stitch cams pass over
the needle butts before the new course is made, if they were
allowed, preparatory to drawing a longer stitch in the next
course, to drop down to a point below where the previous
stitch was drawn, they would ride on the butts of the needles
and cause undue strain on the stitches of that course and
would be very liable to break them, thereby making holes in
the fabric. This is prevented by holding up these two cams
one course. This is done by providing two catches to receive
and hold them when they are raised at the left of the machine,
but when the carriage is moved to the extreme right of the
machine the two small levers, <i>l</i> and <i>k</i>, come in contact with two
studs and release the catches, and allow the two cams to drop
down on their respective pins.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has been explained that in making what are known as
cotton backs and like fabrics the cotton yarn, or yarn that must
show on one side only, must at all times be fed in the locks
that are in the lead, on a double lock machine, while the
worsted or wool yarn which shows on the other side must feed
into the following pair. To do this the yarn carriers must be
exchanged at the end of each course. To explain how this is
done we will refer to Fig. 52, where the plungers that engage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>the yarn carrier blocks and moves them back and forth with
the locks, are shown at <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>These plungers never take more than two carriers at one
time. In these machines there may be four or more bars or
ways for yarn carriers, and in the preceding explanation of
how the yarn carriers are stopped we assumed that the carriers
in question were being operated on the lower ways by the
outside end of the plungers <i>x</i>. For this present explanation
we will assume that we are using the carriers on the top bar
or way, and they would be operated by the end of the plungers
towards the center of the carriage.</p>

<p class='c006'>It will be recalled that when the yarn carrier block comes
to the stop at the edge of the fabric, the plunger is raised out
of engagement with its shoulder, and the block stops while the
plunger passes on. When the carrier block that is being moved
across by the plunger in the lead stops, the one that follows
will also pass over the block without moving it, as the outside
end of the block is beveled off to compel this.</p>

<p class='c006'>It will be noticed that the inside ends of the back plungers
at <i>y</i> are flattened, and the flat sides are at right angles to the
travel of the carriage. Now we will assume the carriage is
traveling from right to left, and the cotton carrier is being
moved along by the plunger in the lead, or <i>y</i> on the left. When
this carrier comes to the stop on the left this plunger leaves it
there and passes on, also the plunger on the right will pass on
over the carrier block. But upon the return of the carriage
moving toward the right the first plunger coming in contact
with the yarn carrier block, which would be <i>y</i> on the right and
which would now be in the lead, would engage the shoulder of
the block and take it across.</p>

<p class='c006'>It will be noted that the two front plungers are also
flattened at <i>x</i>, but are different from the back ones in this
respect; the inside flat is at right angles to the travel of the
carriage while the outside flats are at an angle of about 45
degrees. The yarn carrier operated on this side is stopped at
the edge of the fabric with the plungers passing over and
beyond it the same as the back one. But upon the return
of the carriage the first plunger cannot pick up the carrier
block as the side of the plunger coming in contact with the
shoulder of the block is beveled off and cannot catch, but when
the second plunger comes along with its flat side at right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>angles to its movement, it will engage the shoulder of the
carrier block and take it along.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may have been noticed in Fig. 45 that the machine illustrated
has two separate fabrics on it. This is done very often
when a knitter has a large machine and has no wide work to
make. He simply utilizes the greater part of the machine by
making two narrow fabrics.</p>

<p class='c006'>When this is done both fabrics must be the same vertically
or lengthwise of the fabric, but they may be of different widths
and of different colors. This is made possible by the system
of carriers and blocks mounted on ways together with the
stops, as just described.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are two carriers mounted on each way or bar, instead
of one as previously explained, and stops are placed at each
side of both fabrics so the plungers, either <i>y</i> or <i>x</i> or both,
according to how many carriers are in use, will drop one carrier
at the edge of one of the fabrics and pick up the other carrier
to knit the course on the second fabric.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_8 c012'><span class='sc'>We</span> have explained what fashioned work is and how it is
done by hand. Fig. 53 shows a machine built by Dubied
&amp; Co., which does this work by widening the fabric
automatically in the knitting operation. It is called an automatic
widening machine, and is particularly adapted to making
sleeves. It overcomes the principal objection knitters have to
making shaped work—that is, the extra labor involved, and has
the advantages before-mentioned—namely, no material to be cut
away to get the shape, a selvedge edge which means a small
neat seam, and the proper shape for a proper fit.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>The Widening Device</h3>
<p class='c005'>To the casual observer, the widening machine would look
to be a very complicated piece of mechanism, but as a matter
of fact the widening device is surprising in its simplicity.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>

<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 54.</i><br />Widening Mechanism, Dubied Automatic Widening Machine.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>Fig. 54 shows the principle of the method used. The drawing
does not by any means reproduce the parts as made, but only
shows the principle employed to secure these results, with all
superfluous parts eliminated.</p>

<p class='c006'>The machine proper is a full automatic machine, practically
the same as we have just finished with in the last article, with
the exception of the needle plates and the needles that are used,
and the addition of the widening mechanism. The needle
plates are made almost twice as wide as the regular plates,
with a gib running through the middle of the lower part as
shown. The needles used for the narrowest part of the fabric,
and which are never used in the widening operation, are shown
by the letter <i>a</i> in Fig. 56, and have one butt only as indicated
at <i>b</i>. The needles used in widening have one butt at the same
distance from the hook as the regular needles, as at <i>c</i>, and in
addition to this they have a second butt at the lower end of
the shank extension which reaches down under the narrow
gib to the lower half of the plate, as indicated at <i>d</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>The slot in the needle plate, at the lower edge, is cut all
the way through the plate up to a point which would about
equal the distance between the needles up in working position
and the needles down. There are needle springs, shown at <i>n</i>
in Fig. 54, below each needle which, when the needles are down,
project just below the bottom edge of the plate, and when
pushed up to hold the needles in working position would have
their lower ends about where the lower butts of the widening
needles are when down, as shown. The needle spring is shown
in Fig. 56, at <i>e</i>, in its position relative to the needle, the upper
portion at <i>e</i> fitting in the needle slot below the needle, while
the lower part acts as a clamp on the under side of the plate.</p>

<p class='c006'>The lever shown at <i>f</i> in Fig. 54, together with the slide <i>g</i>
and the stop <i>h</i>, is enclosed in a cast block and they, together
with the yarn carrier stop <i>i</i>, move freely lengthwise of the
small shaft <i>e</i>. There is attached to this block a cord <i>q</i>, which
runs over the small pulley <i>o</i> with a weight attached as at <i>p</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>It naturally follows that this weight would pull the block,
lever, carrier stop and all, over to the extreme right if there
were nothing in the way to stop it. The stop <i>h</i> is for this
purpose. It is stationary in the block and extends up to the
plate, while the slide <i>g</i> is cut back far enough to clear the lower
ends of the springs <i>n</i> which are below the needles.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>Pushing Needle Into Working Position</h3>
</div>
<p class='c005'>Inasmuch as these springs extend a trifle below the plate
when the long needles are down and the stop <i>h</i> comes up in
close proximity to the bottom edge of the plate, this stop will
engage the left side of the spring and prevent the block, together
with the lever <i>f</i> and slide <i>g</i>, from moving toward the right.
Now in order to widen the fabric one stitch or wale it is
simply necessary to push the needle <i>r</i> up into working position.
This is done by moving the cam block, <i>a</i>, longitudinally, which
would necessarily raise the lever <i>d</i>, which, through the rocker
shaft <i>e</i> and lever <i>f</i>, would push the slide <i>g</i>, together with the
spring <i>n</i> and needle <i>r</i>, up high enough to put this needle into
working position.</p>

<p class='c006'>It should be understood that there are four of these widening
mechanisms as shown in Fig. 54, one on each end of both
front and back needle plates, but as they are all operated in
the same manner it will be necessary to describe and explain
but one.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now to explain how this is done automatically we will refer
to Fig. 55, which shows the cam side of the carriage of the
automatic widening machine. It will be noted that on the ends
of the four fixed extensions <i>b</i>1, <i>b</i>2, <i>b</i>3 and <i>b</i>4, there are rollers
<i>a</i>1 to <i>a</i>4, attached with shouldered screws whose heads are
flush with the end of the rollers. As we are dealing with only
one we will select <i>a</i>1, which is the one that would operate on
the block <i>a</i>, Fig. 54, when turned over and placed on the
machine.</p>

<p class='c006'>This roller is in the proper position to engage the cam <i>b</i>
(Fig. 54) when the carriage is at the right end of the machine,
and when the carriage is at the end of its travel the roller would
be at about the point <i>B</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>It naturally follows that inasmuch as cam <i>b</i> is attached to
the block <i>a</i> on an inclined plane, and the block <i>a</i> is attached to
the frame of the machine in such a manner that it cannot move
lengthwise of the machine, but may be moved freely in an
up-and-down direction, when the roller moves through the
camway between cam <i>b</i> and cam <i>c</i> the block must move upward,
thereby pushing up one needle. Upon the return of the carriage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>the roller coming in contact with cam <i>c</i> will return the block
to its first position.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the block <i>a</i> is moved down by the roller, after pushing
up the needle, it must necessarily draw the slide <i>g</i> back to the
position shown, and inasmuch as the lever <i>f</i> slides freely lengthwise
on the shaft <i>e</i>, and there is nothing to prevent, the weight
<i>p</i> will draw all of this part of the mechanism over one needle
or until the stop <i>h</i> comes in contact with the next needle
spring <i>n</i>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Now, it should be understood that, as a rule, a fabric is not
widened a needle each round, therefore the block <i>a</i> (Fig. 54)
is arranged so it will drop below the plane of travel of the
roller <i>a</i>1 (Fig. 55) when widening is not desired. Perhaps it
would be more correct to say that the normal position of block a
is below the plane of travel of the roller <i>a</i>1, therefore out of
operation and is raised up in the path of this roller by a stud
on the widening chain <i>A</i>, Fig. 53, at the proper time to push
the needle up into operation. Upon the return of the carriage
it drops down to its normal position until another needle is to
be added to the fabric. The position of the block <i>a</i> in Fig. 54,
in relation to the rest of the machine, may be seen at <i>B</i> in
Fig. 53.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>Returning the Needles</h3>
</div>
<p class='c005'>As stated before, a fabric to be shaped on this machine must
be started at its narrowest part, therefore when the garment
or part of a garment is finished, these needles which have been
pushed up to widen it must be returned to their lowest position
where they are out of operation, in order to start a new piece.
This is where the second and lower butts of the needles come
into use. They are operated on by the cams <i>c</i>1 to <i>c</i>4, and <i>d</i>1 to
<i>d</i>4, Fig. 55.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i083.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 56.</i><br />Needles and Needle Springs Used in Automatic Widening Machine.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>These cams are arranged so that normally they are raised
up in the cam plate and pass over the lower butts of the needles,
but they may be lowered to operate the needles and raised
again, all automatically, at the proper time and place by slides
and levers similar to those described in a previous article on
the automatic machine. The manner of returning the widening
needles to their lowest position so they will be out of operation
should be obvious to the reader after the foregoing explanations
and a study of the illustrations.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the time comes to cast off these added stitches in
order to start a new sleeve or fabric, the plate on which cams
<i>c</i>1 and <i>d</i>1 are attached is automatically lowered when the
carriage is over to the extreme right. Then upon its return
the lower needle butts of the widening needles will come in
contact with the left side of cam <i>d</i>1, and moving up over the
top of this will, of course, raise the needles to a point where
the latches are above the stitches. As the carriage moves
farther along, and the butts come in contact with the left side
of cam <i>c</i>1, they will slide down and cast the stitches off over the
latch and hook, and at the same time be drawn down to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>point so low that the knitting or upper cams cannot operate
on the upper butts.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the same time that the cams <i>c</i>1 and <i>d</i>1 are lowered to
cast off and draw out of operation the widening needles, a
plunger, which is attached to the carriage, drops down and
engages a recess on the under side of the yarn carrier stop <i>i</i>,
Fig. 54, and through the lug <i>j</i> moves the lever <i>f</i>, together with
the slide <i>g</i> and stop <i>h</i>, back to its first position where the
plunger is disengaged by an inclined stop. The stop <i>h</i> will
hold this part of the mechanism in this place by contact with
the first needle spring as explained before.</p>

<p class='c006'>It should be understood that while this explanation covers
only one of the four corners that must have the needles pushed
up to widen the fabric, the method applies to all of them.
Also in the manner of casting off the widening needles and
returning them to their lowest positions preparatory to starting
a new fabric, we have confined ourselves to the right end of
the front plate only in order to present the matter in the
simplest possible manner. In actual practice the pair of cams
on the left, indicated by <i>c</i>3 and <i>d</i>3, together with <i>c</i>4 and <i>d</i>4,
are put into operation first by a medium stud on the widening
chain while the carriage is at the extreme left end. Upon the
return movement of the carriage these cams would cast off and
return the widening needles to their lowest point on the left
end of both front and back plates. Immediately this is done
the cams are released by means provided, and they again rise
up into the plate out of the working position, thus passing over
the right side widening needles without effect.</p>

<p class='c006'>After putting on one full round the cams <i>d</i>1 and <i>c</i>1, together
with cams <i>d</i>2 and <i>c</i>2, are put into operation at the extreme
right end of the machine by a high stud on the widening chain,
and these cast off and draw down out of operation the front
and back widening needles on the right in the same manner
as heretofore explained.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>Yarn Carrier Stop</h3>
<p class='c005'>The reader will realize from what has gone before that
when there are needles added to or taken from the edge of
a fabric, while in the process of knitting on a machine, it
would be necessary to arrange to change the stopping position
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>of the yarn carrier in order to prevent it from stopping too
far away from or too close in to the fabric as the widening
operation progresses. This is done by the simple expedient of
having the yarn carrier stop mounted on its bar or way so it
will slide freely, and providing the lugs <i>j</i> and <i>k</i>, Fig. 54, on
both sides of the lever <i>f</i>, so that it, with the lever <i>f</i>, and slide <i>g</i>,
with stop <i>h</i>, will at all times move together. Therefore the
needle on the edge of the fabric and the yarn carrier stops
are always in the same relative position.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the reader has stopped to ponder on the working of this
machine, with the resultant fabric, he may realize that there
should be more pull or tension on the fabric during the last part
of it than when it is started. As there have been needles added
it is wider. This has been provided for so that by placing
high studs on the main chain at the proper point they will
increase the tension on the take-up rollers where and as much
as needed. When the widening needles are cast off, and the
width of the fabric is reduced to its narrowest portion, this
extra tension may be automatically released and the pull reduced
to the proper strain for the narrower fabric.</p>

<p class='c006'>These machines are made only in the double lock type, but
there are means provided through the before described levers
and slides to change automatically to single lock by raising one
pair of the locks up out of operation. This is quite an
advantage where one wishes to make some style of garment
with a rack showing on both sides of the fabric such as the
turned-up cuff on ladies’ sweaters, etc.</p>

  <h2 id='ch09' class='c004'>CHAPTER IX <br /> <br /> <span class='sc'>Purl Stitch, or Links and Links Machine, for Hand or Manual Power</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_8 c012'><span class='sc'>The</span> purl stitch or links and links machine is a type which
may be termed unique in the class of machinery built to
make knitted fabrics. It is entirely a European development;
in fact, to my knowledge there had been none of these
machines built in this country until some time after the war
started, when it was impossible to import them.</p>

<p class='c006'>The chief individual characteristic of purl stitch machines
lies in the fact that they have two needle plates, but only one
set of needles, and the cams do not act directly on the needles,
but act indirectly through what are called jacks. First we will
try to get a thorough knowledge of the fabric this machine was
primarily designed to make, and the stitch formation required
to produce this fabric; then the mechanism and movements of
the different parts of the machine will be more readily understood
as we proceed with the explanation.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>Character of Fabric</h3>
<p class='c005'>Fig. 57 shows a photographic reproduction of the fabric
with the top turned over to show both sides, which it will be
noted are exactly the same. Fig. 58 is a line drawing showing
the formation of the stitch; the course that the yarn takes may
easily be followed. This is called the purl stitch and is very
popular with milady when making hand knit sweaters, children’s
suits, etc.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the reader will refer back to Fig. 12, he may be surprised
to note how near this fabric is like the back of the jersey
fabric, while the face of the jersey fabric is so different. I
do not think that I should go very far wrong if I put this in
the same class as the jersey fabric, the same as the half and
full cardigan are classed as rib fabrics. It is made the same
as the jersey on one set of needles, but with this difference:
In making the jersey fabric the loop is always drawn through
the previous loop in the same direction. That is, we will
suppose we were making this jersey fabric on an ordinary flat
machine, on the front plate only. In this case the loops would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>always be drawn toward you through the previous loops. Now
if we should reverse every course the direction in which we
draw these loops, or in other words, if we should draw them
towards you when moving the carriage from right to left, and
away from you when moving the carriage from left to right,
and continued this reversal, we would make a purl stitch fabric.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, you say, how are we going to do this? The solution is
the purl stitch or links and links machine, with its double
ended needle, or a needle with a hook and latch on both ends
to permit the whole needle to be pushed through the loop every
course, thereby casting the previous loops off one end on one
course, and off the opposite end on the next course. This
system of knitting is such that there can be no obstruction
to the free movement of the stitch over any part of the needle,
therefore this fact precludes the use of a butt projecting up
from any part for the cams to operate on, even if there were
no other reason, which there is as the reader will understand
after a study of the subject.</p>

<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 58.</i><br />Construction of the Plain Purl<br />Stitch Fabric.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c006'>This machine is constructed somewhat along the lines of the
ordinary flat machine, which we have been studying. Its
points of similarity are that the table or stand is the same, it
has two straight, flat needle plates, it has a carriage which is
moved backward and forward over the needle plates to
operate the needles, and the cams or locks are practically the
same as in the ordinary single lock flat machine. The main
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>points of difference are that on the purl stitch machine the
needle plates are set so that they are flat, or both are on a
horizontal plane, and the needle slots of both plates are directly
in alignment with one another so a needle may move freely
from the front to the back plate, or vice versa. The ordinary
flat machine has the needle plates set at an angle of about
90 degrees to one another, and 45 degrees to the horizontal, and
they are set lengthwise so the needle slots of one plate are
opposite the space between the needle slots of the opposite plate,
or in a position so the needles of one plate will come up between
the needles of the opposite plate.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another point of difference is that the purl stitch machine
has one set of needles for both plates, with a hook and latch on
both ends of each needle and no butts to operate them, while
the ordinary machine has a set of needles for each plate with
a hook and latch on one end only with a butt on the other end
to operate it. It naturally follows that inasmuch as the needle
plates are set flat, instead of at an angle to one another, and
the needles are operated indirectly through what are called
jacks instead of directly on butts on the needles, the construction
of the purl stitch machine must be somewhat different
from the ordinary flat machine.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>Construction of Purl Stitch Machine</h3>
<p class='c005'>Fig. 59 shows a general view of a purl stitch machine built
by Dubied &amp; Co. The letter <i>a</i> indicates the carriage, <i>b</i> the
handle used to operate the carriage, and <i>c</i> is an auxiliary
handle which some knitters like and use, while others take it
off, preferring the use of handle <i>b</i> only. The letter <i>i</i> indicates
the connection rod for the auxiliary handle; <i>d</i> is the racking
handle for racking the back plate, which plate is made to
rack over usually about 12 needles. The letter <i>e</i> is a sector
of a circle attached to the frame of the machine and acts as
a guide and a stop for the racking handle. This may be studied
to better advantage in Fig. 60, at <i>e</i>. It has V-shaped notches
cut at the proper intervals to correspond to the needle spacing
with a V-shaped plunger attached to the handle so that when
this plunger springs into one of the notches it brings the
needle slots of the back plate into alignment with the needle
slots of the front plate.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>The secondary handle <i>d</i>-1 is for releasing this plunger to
permit the handle to be moved. It will be noted that there
are holes in this sector, one back of each notch in the edge, and
in two of these holes there are pins. These pins may be placed
in any desired hole and act as stops for the racking handle and
in this way save the operator the trouble of stopping to count
the number of notches every time he racks, as on this class of
work racking over anywhere from two to twelve needles at
one time is common practice.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>To go back to Fig. 59, letter <i>f</i> is a counter for counting the
rounds, <i>g</i> indicates two yarn carrier stops, one on each side
of the bar or gib, while <i>h</i> and <i>h</i> are the yarn take-up frames
and springs. Letter <i>j</i> indicates the two gibs or ways on which
the carriage slides, and <i>k</i> is the bar for carrying the yarn
carriers.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now to get an insight into the principle of the method of
making this purl stitch we will first give our attention to
Fig. 63, which is a line drawing of a needle and the two jacks
which are required for each needle in their proper relative
positions.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>How Needles Are Operated</h3>
</div>
<p class='c005'>As will be surmised after looking at the drawing, the jacks
are moved forward and backward by cams operating on the
butts <i>a</i> and <i>a</i>, which project above the surface of the needle
plate in the same manner as the cams operate on the needle
butts in the ordinary flat machine. The jacks operate the
needles by catching the hook of the needles in the clutches <i>b</i>
and <i>b</i> of the jacks. These needles are simply passed, so to
speak, back and forth across the throat, between the needle
plates, from one jack to the opposite one on each course, and
in that way they reverse the direction of the draw of the loop
on each course.</p>

<p class='c006'>We will now give our attention to Fig. 62, which shows
the under or cam side of the carriage. It is understood, of
course, that lengthwise of the carriage, or the direction of
movement, would be what is crosswise or right and left in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>illustration. It will be noted that the locks or stitch cam
arrangement are, on the whole, practically the same as in the
ordinary flat machine. This would apply to the cams and locks
including <i>a</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>k</i> and <i>g</i>, also <i>b</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>l</i> and <i>j</i>. The bridges <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>
are for another purpose.</p>

<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 61.</i><br />Top of Carriage. Dubied Purl Stitch Machine.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It will be noted that while the stitch cams <i>h</i> and <i>i</i>, also <i>g</i>
and <i>j</i>, are exactly opposite one another, the cams <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are
not. The bridges <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> have perfectly flat smooth surfaces
except at points <i>e</i> and <i>f</i>, and here they have a concave portion
about one-eighth of an inch deep. The space between bridge <i>c</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>and cam <i>k</i>, also between bridge <i>d</i> and cam 1, is filled by the
needle gib 1, Fig. 60, and its mate on the back, which cannot
be seen, when the carriage is on the machine. The reader
should carefully study the points just gone over, that is, the
location of the cams <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> in relation to each other, and the
bridges <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> with their concave spots <i>e</i> and <i>f</i>, in order to
fully grasp their relation to the jacks and needles in the
operation of the machine.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>We will now give our attention to
Fig. 60, where it will be noted that the
front gib 1 is abnormally wide. The
back gib is the same, and inasmuch as
it cannot be seen we will assume that it
is also marked 1 and hereafter call it back
gib 1. Just below the center, laterally,
of the front needle plate we see a row
of jack butts which are in working position.
In the back plate we see jack butts
in every slot but they alternate with
three up in working position, and three
down out of working position. It should
be understood clearly that any jacks that
are moved to the outer edge of either
plate will not operate as they are out of
range of the cam system, the same as in
the ordinary flat machine.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 63.</i><br />Jacks and Needles Used in the Dubied Purl Stitch Machine.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Let us now bring together the needles
and jacks in Fig. 63, and the needle plates
in Fig. 60. The butts of the jacks <i>a</i>
(Fig. 63) are what we see projecting
above the needle plates in Fig. 60. The
hump <i>c</i> (Fig. 63) lies under the gib 1
(Fig. 60). The reason for having this
gib extra wide is to cover this hump
during most of the knitting operation in
order to keep the needle captive. The
depth of the needle slot is just sufficient
to allow this part of the jack to slide
under the gib freely without any up and
down play, therefore it follows that when
the hook of a needle is caught in the
clutch <i>b</i>, as in jack number 1 in Fig. 63,
that needle must move backward and
forward with the jack. When the jacks
are moved forward to the point where the
butts would be near or against the gib 1
(Fig. 60) the hump <i>c</i> (Fig. 63) would be
inside and clear of the gib 1, toward the
center of the machine, therefore the
shank of the jack being narrower than at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>the hump, a slight draw on the needle would free it from the
jack as the clutch <i>d</i>, which holds the needle, is beveled off for
this purpose. This being the case it follows that when the
jacks are in this position the hooks of the needles may be
easily pushed under and into the clutch <i>b</i> of the jacks. This
is how the machine is filled with needles to begin with, or
imperfect ones replaced with new.</p>

<p class='c006'>It will now be necessary to study Fig. 62 in connection with
Figs. 60 and 63. Referring to Fig. 62, the space between the
cam <i>k</i> and bridge <i>c</i>, also cam 1 and bridge <i>d</i>, as noted before,
is occupied by the two gibs 1 (Fig. 60) when the carriage is
on the machine. The bridges <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> (Fig. 62) come down to
the needle plates and the surface we see is on the same plane
as the under side of the gibs 1, Fig. 60. We have just had
the statement that when the butts of the jacks <i>a</i> (Fig. 63)
were moved up to the outside and close to the gibs 1 (Fig. 60),
the hump <i>c</i> of the jacks would be just inside and clear of the
gibs 1, therefore could be raised sufficiently to slip the hook of
a needle in or out of the clutch <i>b</i> of the jack. This is true only
at a time when the carriage is not over and operating the jacks.</p>

<p class='c006'>When these are moved up to this point by the cams the
hump <i>c</i> of the jacks would come under the bridges <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>
(Fig. 62), therefore could not raise up to release the needles
except at the narrow concaves marked <i>e</i> and <i>f</i> in the bridges.
These concaves, it should be noted again, are not opposite one
another. The distance between the top or narrow part of
cam <i>a</i> and cam <i>b</i> is such that when the butts of the jacks
have moved up to this point the clutch <i>b</i> of both of the opposed
jacks cover a hook of the needle. In looking at Fig. 62, the
top half of the carriage would be the part covering the front
needle plate and operating upon the front jacks, and the bottom
half would do likewise on the back plate. When the carriage
is at the left end of the machine, when making the purl stitch
the needles should be in the front plate, and when the carriage
is at the right end of the machine the needles would be in the
back plate. This relative position is always the same when
making the purl stitch.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have assumed that the reader understands that a jack
and a needle together would, when in a normal position as
shown by the butts in the front needle plate in Fig. 60, reach
just to the throat between the needle plates. Having the
different parts and their relative positions in our mind we will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>now proceed with the modus operandi. We will assume that
the carriage is at the left end of the machine, therefore the
needles would be in the front needle plate and under the control
of the front jacks, as the hooks would be in the clutch <i>b</i> (Fig.
63) of these jacks, while the hump <i>c</i> being under the gib of
the needle plate will not allow the needles to escape. To obviate
some of the difficulties the reader may have in understanding
this explanation we will assume that the carriage as shown in
Fig. 62 is stationary, and the plates with their jacks and
needles are the parts that are moved.</p>

<p class='c006'>The outline of the camway may be easily traced as it is
practically the same as the ordinary flat machine with which
the reader should be familiar and the action on the needles,
through the jacks, is the same until they reach the first inside
corner of the cam <i>b</i>. If the reader will take a straight edge
and lay it on the illustration, he will find that this corner of
cam <i>b</i> is just in line with the concave <i>e</i> in the bridge <i>c</i>, and
also with the center of the flat portion of the cam <i>a</i>. This
being the case, it follows that the center of the flat portion of
the cam <i>b</i> must be in line with the left inside corner of cam <i>a</i>
and the concave <i>f</i> in the bridge <i>d</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>It should be understood that as the needles are moving
across the throat between the needle plates, the stitch or loop
opens the latches, and guards are provided to keep them
open until the needles are ready to draw the new loop through
the previous one.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now to return to where we left the needles and jacks at
the right inside corner of cam <i>b</i>. The jacks of the back plate
have reached their innermost position, and the heads or humps
<i>c</i> (Fig. 63) lie under the bridge <i>c</i> (Fig. 62). At the point
where the front jacks opposite are reaching their innermost
position, the heads or humps <i>c</i> of the back jacks come under the
concave <i>e</i>, which allows the hook of the needles, just coming
forward from the opposite plate, to raise up the head and
enter the clutch <i>b</i> of the jack. As they move farther to the
left, the heads of these back jacks are under the plane surface
of the bridge <i>c</i>, which secures the needles to these jacks. As
the jacks start to move back toward their outermost position,
the heads of the jacks of the front plate are under the concave
<i>f</i> of bridge <i>d</i>. This allows the needle hooks of this end to
draw out and release themselves from the jacks of this side,
and be drawn through the loop to the back plate, and by this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>means to cast the previous loop off from the back plate toward
the front one.</p>

<p class='c006'>Upon the return from left to right, the needles are exchanged
from the back plate to the front one in the same
manner, only of course, the action is just opposite to that just
explained. Therefore, the needles would pass through the loop
from the back to the front plate, and cast off the previous
loop from the front plate toward the back one. This would
make the purl stitch.</p>

<p class='c006'>While the machine was designed primarily to make this purl
stitch, there can be made on it a larger variety of stitches than
on any other machine, but in general practice the stitches
made are limited as a rule to the purl, jersey and plain rib,
1 and 1, 2 and 2, etc. The term 1 and 1 rib means one needle
in each plate alternately. The term 2 and 2 rib means two
needles together alternating in each plate without a needle
working between the two from the opposite plate. It is also
possible to make the half or full cardigan stitch.</p>

<p class='c006'>The jersey stitch may be made by one of two methods.
First, when the needles are all in one plate move the jacks in
the other plate to their outermost position, where the cams
of that side cannot operate on them and the needles will stay
on one side as there are no jacks operating on the other side
to take them across. Second, by moving the handle <i>b</i>, Fig. 61,
to the left. By doing this we would draw the cams <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>
(Fig. 62) up into the cam plate out of working position,
therefore the jacks would not move to their innermost position
so the needles would not move far enough forward to meet
the opposite jacks and could not be taken over into the opposite
plate. This system of being able to operate any number of
selected needles, or all of them, on either the purl or jersey
stitch, either alone or in combination with the rack, is the base
or principle used to make practically all the designed or pattern
work produced on the ordinary purl stitch machine.</p>

<p class='c006'>Fig. 61 shows the top side of the carriage. The letter <i>a</i>
indicates the handle for operating the carriage; <i>b</i> is the lever
for changing the stitch from purl to jersey, or vice versa, by
raising out or putting into operation the cams <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, Fig. 62.
The letter <i>c</i> shows the lever for changing yarn carriers while
<i>d</i>1 and <i>d</i>2 are the slides for changing the length of stitch. This
change is made the same as has been explained for the ordinary
flat machine; that is, by shifting the stops, of which there are
three for each stitch cam or six on each of the slides <i>d</i>1 and <i>d</i>2.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_8 c012'><span class='sc'>Figures</span> 64, 65 and 66 show some of the design effects
which may be made on the links and links system of knitting.
Fig. 64 is a basket weave design. To make this we
will assume that the machine is set up, that is, has work on
it, with the carriage at the left end of the machine. Then all
the needles would be in the front plate. The back plate should
be racked to its last position to the right. The last working
jack in the back plate, left end, should be opposite the last
needle in the front plate, but in the right end of the back
plate there should be 8 jacks more than needles in the front
plate. Now starting at the right, count eight jacks, which
leave in operating position; then
draw five back out of operating
position; leave eleven in operation,
and drawn five out.
Alternate in this way with
eleven in work and five out for
the length of the work.</p>

<div  class='figleft id005'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 64.</i><br />Basket Weave Design Made on Purl Stitch Hand Machine.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>After doing this the position
of the jacks would be similar to
those shown in the back plate in
Fig. 60, except that that illustration
showed three in and
three out, while we would have
eleven in work and five out in
the present instance. The three
rules marked <i>m</i>, shown in Fig.
60, are used for this purpose.
They save the time of counting
the jacks and drawing them
back one or two at a time. By
the use of one of these rules,
properly cut, all of the jacks to be put out of operation may be
moved back in one sweep.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>To go back to our design, set the pin shown in the arc <i>e</i>, Fig.
60, to stop the racking handle at eight needles, put on six
courses or three rounds, stopping with the carriage on the
left, which will leave all the needles in the front plate, and
rack the back plate to eight needles to the left. Put on three
more rounds and rack the eight needles to the right, and
continue doing this.</p>

<p class='c006'>It should be understood that the back plate should never
be racked over more than two needles except when all the
needles are in the front plate. I have previously explained that
when the cams are set for purl stitch, if the jacks are in the
operating position in both plates we would make the purl
stitch, but in any place where the jacks were drawn back out
of operating position in one plate, in that place the needles
would at all times stay in the opposite plate and knit the plain
jersey stitch.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now in this basket design we have in the back plate, disregarding
the first eight jacks, five jacks that are not operating
alternating with eleven that are. Therefore, the first three
rounds would make purl stitch on eleven needles alternating
with five making plain jersey stitch.</p>

<p class='c006'>When we rack the plate over eight needles we find that the
five slots with the non-working jacks of the back plate are just
opposite the middle five needles of the eleven that have been
making purl stitch, and are, of course, at the time of racking
in the front plate. We also find that the five needles that have
been making the jersey stitch in consequence of having been
opposite the five non-working jacks in the back plate, are now
opposite the middle five of the eleven working jacks of the back
plate. Therefore it is plain that these five needles would make
purl stitch for the next three rounds, while the middle five
needles of the eleven that were making purl stitch would make
jersey in the next three rounds. There are always three needles
on each side of the five that are racked over that purl stitch
all the time.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>Two and Two Rib</h3>
<p class='c005'>Fig. 65 shows two designs the lower one being very simple.
With the carriage on the left end of the machine arrange the
jacks in the back plate two and two, or two in working position
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>and two out. Then move the carriage across to the right end
of the machine and we will find that the needles have arranged
themselves to conform to the arrangement of the back jacks,
alternating two and two in both
needle plates. Now move the
handle <i>b</i>, Fig. 61, to the left and
this will raise cams <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>,
Fig. 62, up into the cam plate
out of operation, thus preventing
the jacks from moving to
their innermost position. Therefore,
they cannot exchange
needles and so would make a
two and two rib fabric, knitting
this continuously without any
further change.</p>

<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 65.</i><br />Diagonal Diamond Design<br />and Two and Two Rib Made on<br />Hand Purl Stitch Machine.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The upper half of Fig. 65
is made by arranging the jacks
in the back needle plate so that
five will be in working position,
alternating with five out. With
this arrangement of the jacks,
and without any further manipulation,
the machine would
knit a straight vertical stripe of five needles purl stitch and
five needles plain jersey stitch. If, however, we rack the
back needle over one needle every round when the carriage
is at the left end of the machine, and all the needles are in
the front plate, for five rounds we would have these stripes
running diagonally instead of vertically, and the distance they
would run to the right or left, depending on which way we
racked, would depend on how many times we racked in one
direction. In this instance it would be for seven rounds, or
rather we would rack over in the one direction every round
for six rounds, and on the seventh we would rack the plate
back the five needles at once. Then start over racking the
other way one needle each round as before to make the second
row of diagonal blocks. This racking back of five needles at
one time would of course bring the non-working jacks to the
position where the working jacks were, and the working jacks
to the position where the non-working jacks were. Therefore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>the needles that were knitting the purl stitch would begin
making plain jersey, while the needles that were making plain
jersey would now make purl stitch.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Fig. 66 is simply a two and
two rib stitch racked over two
needles every four rounds. This
racking over two needles with
needles in both plates may be
done successfully if the stitch
is drawn fairly long.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>Automatic Jacquard Power Purl Stitch Machine</h3>

<p class='c005'>The automatic links and
links or purl stitch machine is
what the name would imply;
that is, a machine which makes
the changes in the stitch and
yarn carriers automatically. The
word jacquard added to this
would convey to the mind of
a person familiar with textile
processes the fact that the machine
automatically makes designs
or patterns in the process
of knitting.</p>

<p class='c006'>Fig. 67 shows a Dubied machine of this type which in
general appearance resembles their automatic power flat
machine. It has the same drum device for counting the rounds,
indicated at <i>d</i>, with a chain drive somewhat similar to the flat
machine, though with this difference: The carriage is connected
directly to the chain through a cross head which slides
on two rods, instead of through a connection rod. We have
the main chain, at <i>e</i>, on this machine as on the flat machine,
but it is placed on the right end instead of the left. The
racking chains which are on the flat machine are not needed
on this machine, therefore are dispensed with.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>On the ordinary purl stitch machine a large part of the
designing is done by a combination of selected jacks in conjunction
with the rack; therefore it is desirable to have such
a machine built to rack over quite a number of needles. With
this machine the designs are made on the jacquard system,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>therefore this extreme racking is not required and the machine
is built to rack but two needles. At <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> in Fig. 67 will be
noted two cylinders with grooves cut on a long spiral. They
are mounted on a small shaft which acts as a bearing upon
which they turn. These operate the jacquard system and
should be kept well in mind as they will be referred to later.
The letter <i>c</i> indicates the carriage, which is shown, top and
bottom, in detail in Figs. 69 and 70.</p>

<p class='c006'>Fig. 69, it will be noted, is the same in the general layout
of the cam system as shown for the hand machines in Fig. 62,
in the last article. The upper locks would operate on the
front plate and the lower ones on the back one. There are
two main points of difference: The cam <i>x</i>, which must be used
in connection with the cards of the jacquard system and which
will be taken up in detail in due course, and the levers <i>s</i> and <i>t</i>
which raise the stitch cams that are in the lead and lower
the ones that follow and form the stitch at the end of each
course. This is done to take all undue strain off the stitch.</p>

<p class='c006'>It will be noted in the illustration that the left stitch cams
are raised and the right ones lowered preparatory to putting
on a course by moving the carriage from right to left. At
the left end of the machine the position of these cams is
reversed for the return course. This is done by a pin set at
both ends of the two plates which act on the levers <i>s</i> and <i>t</i>.
Then we have the extensions of the slides. Numbers 1 and 3
are for changing the length of the stitch. Slides 2 and 5 are
for raising and lowering cams <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> to change from purl to
plain jersey stitch, or vice versa. The manner of doing this
and the action of these cams on the needles and jacks have
been explained.</p>

<p class='c006'>Slide 4 puts the plunger <i>y</i> into and out of operation. This
plunger operates the jacquard system by entering the spiral
grooves of and turning the cylinders <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, Fig. 67. The
four slides marked 6, Figs. 69 and 70, are for changing the
yarn carriers, of which there are four. The four small parts
indicated by the letter <i>m</i>, Fig. 69, are latch openers, which are
essential as the machine cannot be operated when the latches
are closed. We would be unable to move the carriage across
the machine when there was no fabric on the needles to open
the latches, without these latch openers.</p>

<p class='c006'>The small slide indicated at 7 is for changing the position
of the cam <i>x</i>, swinging on a pivot screw at <i>z</i>, which may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>moved to any one of three positions. These are the position
shown, or horizontal with the lower edge of, and on a line
with the lower edge of cams <i>w</i> and <i>r</i>, or it may be swung down
to a point where the end will be at the lower edge of the cam
plate at <i>v</i>. The three positions of this cam should be firmly
fixed in mind, as they have an important part to play in the
jacquard work.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We will now give our attention to Fig. 68, which
represents a cross section of the needle plates, showing
a pair of jacks and a needle in their respective slots or
tricks. Letter <i>a</i> indicates the back plate and <i>b</i> the front one.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>The back jack <i>c</i> is shown in its outermost position, therefore
would be out of operation, while the dotted lines at <i>h</i> show
its innermost position ready to receive the needle from the
opposite jack. Letters <i>e</i> and <i>f</i> indicate the gibs which cover
and hold down the heads of the jacks at all times except when
they are at their innermost position; when they are in this
position they are under and held down by the bridges or winkles
<i>c</i> and <i>d</i>, Fig. 69, and are permitted to rise only at the concaves
<i>e</i> and <i>f</i> where the exchange of needles takes place. Letter <i>g</i>,
Fig. 68, indicates the needle, and <i>i</i> is a vertical projection, called
teeth, which are between the needles and act as sinkers for the
needles to draw the loops over.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>The Jacquard Mechanism</h3>
<p class='c005'>The jacquard system of designing is simply a method of
providing means to select and put into operation any desired
needle or needles at any predetermined place in the fabric. The
mechanism to do this is shown in Fig. 68. The letter <i>l</i> indicates
a four cornered star shaped bar called the card cylinder, which
is the length of the needle plate. The letter <i>j</i> indicates what
are called cards and are also the same length as the needle
plate and as wide as one side of the card cylinder. These are
made from either thin sheets of steel or from stiff strong paper
board, and are attached to one another by rings or other
means so as to form a continuous band around the card
cylinder. The illustration shows ten of these cards, but the
number used depends on the design being made, for there is
one card for each round in the design.</p>

<p class='c006'>To return to the card cylinder <i>l</i>, this is mounted on a shaft
which is supported by two uprights or arms, one at each end,
shown by the broken lines at <i>n</i>, which in turn are attached
securely to the rocker shaft <i>m</i>. This arrangement permits the
card cylinder to be swung forward to the needle plate and
back to the position shown at any predetermined time or place.
As noted before, the back jack <i>c</i> is out of working position,
therefore as long as it stays in this position the needle would
operate in the front plate only and make a plain jersey fabric.</p>

<p class='c006'>If, when the carriage is at the left end of the machine, we
should swing the card cylinder with the blank card <i>j</i>, No. 1
(which is a card without any openings in it) up to the needle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>plate, it would push these back jacks up into working position
and on the next course the needles would cross over into the
back plate and make the purl stitch. Now bear in mind that
the basic principle of designing of this character is in making
the design of one stitch and the ground of the other. It is
quite obvious that if we provide means to sweep all the back
jacks to their outermost positions and out of operation every
time the carriage is moved from the right to the left end of
the machine after having passed the needles across to the front
plate, then swing a card with holes cut through at certain
intervals up to the needle plate, those jacks that come into
contact with that part of the card that is intact would be
pushed into working position, while those that were in front
of the openings or holes would pass through and not be
affected. Therefore, on the next round the needles opposite
these would make the jersey stitch, while all the others would
make purl stitch. On the last course of the round from right
to left the jacks would be swept back out of operation, the
card cylinder <i>l</i> would be turned a quarter turn, bringing
another card opposite the needle plate, and another and perhaps
different lot of jacks selected for the next round.</p>

<p class='c006'>The card cylinder is turned the quarter turn when the
carriage is approaching the right end of the machine by the
plunger <i>y</i>, Fig. 70, engaging the spiral in the cylinder <i>b</i>, Fig.
67, and the cards are moved up to the needle plate when the
carriage approaches the left end of the machine by this same
plunger engaging the spiral in cylinder <i>a</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>At <i>k</i> in Fig. 68, is shown the face of a portion of a card
as it might be cut. Beginning at the opening at the left, the
heels of three jacks would pass through this. The space next
to the right, being intact, would push six jacks into operation;
and so on throughout the length of the fragment of the card
shown as indicated by the figures. This drawing was made
to represent a card to be used on a needle plate cut eight
needles to one inch, and while the scale is cut down somewhat
in the reproduction the proportions would remain the same.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now as to the means provided to make the changes shown
as necessary we will refer again to Fig. 69, and to the cam
marked <i>x</i>. As stated before, this cam may be swung on the
pivot screw <i>z</i>, automatically, to any one of three positions.
When it is in alignment with cams <i>w</i> and <i>r</i> it has no effect,
as when the jacks are in their normal knitting position the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>butts will pass just above and when they are out of working
position they will pass just under these three cams. Now it
will be noted that cam <i>x</i> is placed at the extreme right end
of this lock or set of cams, in consequence of which it must
always be put into operation when the carriage is at the right
end of the machine, and it performs its functions as the carriage
is moved to the left and after the stitch formation of this
course is completed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cam is moved into the desired position by the slide 7,
which comes in contact with movable stops at either end of the
machine. When the jacquard system is in operation this cam
would be moved to the position shown in the illustration while
the carriage was on the right, consequently as the carriage
is moved to the left end of the machine the needles in the back
plate would be passed to the front plate and immediately after
this the back jacks would be swept out of the operating position
by this cam.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the carriage reached the left end of the machine this
cam would be moved down in alignment with cams <i>w</i> and <i>r</i>,
so would be in the position that would not make any change in
the position of the jacks.</p>

<p class='c006'>In making some kinds of work it is desirable to put all
the back jacks in and out of operation at certain times. We
have just explained about putting them out of operation. To
put all of them in the working position without using the
jacquard the before mentioned movable stop comes in contact
with another slide just under slide 7, when the carriage is
moved to the right end of the machine, and this slide will
swing the point of cam <i>x</i> to its lowest position at <i>v</i>, and in this
position, as the carriage is moved to the left, it will sweep
all the back jacks into working position ready for the next
course. As the carriage finishes its travel to the left, the stop
at that end would of course move this cam to its neutral point.</p>

<p class='c006'>I assume that the reader understands that the stops and
levers that cause all these automatic changes are controlled
by studs attached in their proper places on the chain <i>e</i>, Fig. 67,
which in turn is controlled by the drum <i>d</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>We will now take up in more detail the action of the cards
and the mechanism provided to actuate them. As stated before,
when making a design by this system the card cylinder, together
with the cards, is moved up to the edge of the needle plate each
round. Referring to Fig. 67, at <i>a</i>-1 there is an eccentric
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>attached to the movable cylinder <i>a</i>, and there is a connection
rod from this eccentric to the small shaft <i>o</i>, Fig. 68. Therefore,
when the plunger <i>y</i>, Fig. 70, enters the spiral groove and
moves the length of the cylinder <i>a</i>, Fig. 67, the cylinder turns
about half way round, which of course turns the eccentric <i>a</i>-1,
and this moves the card <i>j</i>, No. 1, Fig. 68, up to the needle
plate. As noted before, any part of this card that has holes
in it could not push those, jacks opposite into working position,
while that part of the card which remained intact would put
the jacks opposed to it in work. Upon the return of the
carriage it turns the cylinder <i>a</i>, Fig. 67, back to its first position,
which movement would of course move the cards away
from the needle plate again. The cylinder <i>b</i> is actuated in
the same manner as cylinder <i>a</i> as the carriage reaches the
right end of the machine, but its function is to turn the card
cylinder a quarter turn each time in order to bring a new
card into position for the next round and make that part of
the design.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>How Designing Is Done</h3>
<p class='c005'>Having explained the theory of making designs on the
jacquard system we will now show in detail how it is done in
actual practice. With the jacquard system there is no limit
or end to the designs that may be made, as there is with the
other systems used on knitting machines.</p>

<p class='c006'>Fig. 71 is a photographic reproduction of a design made
on this machine. The reader who has studied well and
thoroughly digested what has gone before will realize that this
design could not be made in any other way, on a machine of
this type, without an expenditure of time and labor which
would be far beyond the bounds of practicability.</p>

<p class='c006'>The designer will first sketch out his design on a piece of
plain paper, then take a piece of cross section paper and lay
it down as illustrated in Fig. 72. This is the layout of the
design shown in Fig. 71. Each of the crosswise rows of
squares represents one round or two courses, and each of the
vertical rows represents a wale or needle. In other words
each one of the squares in a crosswise row represents a
needle or the loops in one round, and each one of the succeeding
squares represents that same needle in the succeeding rounds.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Now to cut the cards we would start with No. 1 and cut
them consecutively. Referring to Fig. 72, the blank squares,
or the spaces in the cards these represent, should be cut out,
and the squares marked with an <i>x</i> would remain intact. Starting
at the right side, one needle space is not cut out; then
sufficient space to cover three needles or jacks is cut out;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>then the space of eleven jacks is left intact, then three cut
out. This is the full width of the first round of the design,
therefore this cutting would be repeated until it covers the
desired width of fabric. Card No. 2 would be cut as follows:
One space cut, one left intact, three cut out, nine left intact,
three cut out, and one left intact. This should be repeated as
with No. 1 card. Each card thereafter should be cut according
to the marking of the cross section paper, and numbered as cut,
so as to avoid trouble in assembling them in their proper order
when finished.</p>

<p class='c006'>It should be understood that the part of this layout from
the right side to the dotted line is the complete design, and
all to the left as well as above and below, would be a duplicate
of this.</p>

<p class='c006'>After these cards are put on the card cylinder, attached
like an endless belt, and the machine is in operation, when
card No. 18 has finished the last part of the design, card No. 1
will start immediately in the next round on its part of the
design. When it comes to card No. 6, that square will have
been completed, and a new square in the center section will
have been started.</p>

<p class='c006'>The two-tone color effect is made by using two different
colored yarns and using a plating yarn carrier. This throws
one color on the face in the jersey stitch and the other color
on the face in the purl stitch.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_8 c012'><span class='sc'>The</span> flat latch needle automatic narrowing machine as built
by Messrs. Claes &amp; Flentje is shown in Fig. 73, and a
piece of fabric from this machine narrowed down fourteen
needles is shown in Fig. 74. This machine is quite complicated
when compared with any that have been taken up
before, but those who have studied what has gone before carefully,
especially that part treating on fashioned garments and
how they are made by hand, should have no trouble in understanding
the principles and movements necessary to do this
work automatically.</p>

<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 74.</i><br />Fabric Narrowed Down on Automatic<br />Narrowing Machine.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The machine shown is really
four separate and complete units
mounted upon one frame or
stand and driven by one belt,
with the automatic movements
operated from one control. It
is evident from this that the
garments or parts of garments
made on each one of these four
units must be the same, or
rather they must have the same
number of rounds with the
same number of needles narrowed
down, but they may be
made from different yarns both
in kind and color.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are four points that
should be understood to begin
with: First, the machine is
operated by power. Second, the
power is transmitted to the driving pulley on the machine at
all times when the machine is being operated. Third, the
knitting mechanism must be stopped while the narrowing
mechanism is in operation. Fourth, the narrowing mechanism
must be at rest during the time the knitting mechanism is in
operation.</p>

<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 75.</i><br />Changing Mechanism on Right End of Automatic Narrowing Machine.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>We will first show how it is arranged to automatically stop
one part of the machine, say the knitting operation, and put
the narrowing mechanism in work, and after this part has
performed its functions or narrowed down one needle on each
needle plate, front and back, how it is stopped until time to
narrow again, and the knitting parts set in operation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Fig. 75 is a view of the right end of the machine, and it
is here that the driving mechanism is located, also the automatic
controls. The number 1 indicates the belt and pulley
which drive the machine. The pulley is mounted loose upon
the shaft and operates the machine through a clutch which is
thrown in or out, as the case may be, by the handles marked
<i>x</i> in Fig. 73. The number 13 (Fig. 75) indicates a plain
balance wheel on the outside end of the shaft.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the clutch is in, the driving wheel on which the belt
1 runs will of course turn the shaft 2, on the other end of
which there is a small spur gear which drives the large gear
3. This large gear is automatically connected with, and disconnected
from the crank wheel 5, which wheel drives the
knitting mechanism through the connecting rod 6 and lever <i>y</i>,
Fig. 73, whose fulcrum is at <i>s</i>, and is connected to an extension
of the carriage at <i>r</i>. The lever <i>y</i> comes up between two ways
or slides, on which is mounted a crosshead at the end of this
extension, and where the lever connects at <i>r</i>, to keep the extension
in alignment with the carriages.</p>

<p class='c006'>Referring to Fig. 75, when the machine is being operated
the following parts are always in motion: The driving wheel
1 with the shaft 2, together with the small spur gear on the
end of the shaft 2, which cannot be seen but drives the large
gear 3, also the large gear 3 with the shaft upon which it is
mounted, which may be seen running behind the vertical
connecting straps toward the right of the illustration and
terminates back of the large bevel gear 4. Upon this end of the
shaft there is mounted a small bevel or pinion gear to drive
the large bevel gear 4.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now then let us understand that the crank wheel 5 operates
the knitting mechanism of the machine, and the bevel gear 4,
through a shaft which runs the entire length of the machine
with a series of cams mounted on it, operates the narrowing
mechanism. We have seen that the driving parts from the
driving pulley 1 on the back of the machine, over to and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>including the large gear 3, and back to and including the small
bevel gear which drives the large bevel gear 4 are in motion
at all times while the machine is in operation. The gear 4 is
engaged with the small gear only at the time the narrowing
is done; while the crank wheel is connected with the large
spur gear 3 and turning only while the knitting parts are in
operation. The connection between the crank wheel 5 and the
gear 3 is simply a key-like lever which may be disconnected
by lifting out of place and connected again by dropping back,
though there is only one place on the circumference of the
wheel where it can connect the two together.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>Control of Fashioning Mechanism</h3>

<div  class='figleft id006'>
<img src='images/i116.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 76.</i><br />Needles and Decker<br />Points Used on the<br />Automatic Narrowing<br />Machine.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The method of starting and stopping the narrowing or
fashioning mechanism is quite a novel and ingenious arrangement.
To explain it we will refer to Fig. 81. The number 4
indicates the bevel gear shown at 4 in Fig. 75, and 4-<i>a</i> is the
small pinion a part of which may be seen in Fig. 75. The
larger bevel gear 4 has a small space (three or four teeth) cut
away so it acts somewhat on the principle of
an intermittent gear. When the small pinion
4-<i>a</i> comes to this spot the large gear 4 will of
course stop. This gear is mounted on the
shaft 9, which may be seen under the same
designation in Figs. 79 and 80, which is a
continuation of this shaft. It (the gear 4) is
shown in Fig. 81 in the position where it
would be at rest as the small pinion 4-<i>a</i> would
be turning free and clear on account of the
teeth of the large gear being cut away at
this point.</p>

<p class='c006'>It will be noted that there is a pin extending
from one side of the hub of the small
pinion gear 4-<i>a</i>. On the back of gear 4 there
is attached a box-like arrangement with the
lever 4-<i>b</i> passing through it, which is pivoted
at <i>p</i> and is held out in the position shown by
a spring. Outside and near the outer end of
this lever 4-<i>b</i> is another L-shaped lever 4-<i>d</i>, which is pivoted
at <i>m</i> to the frame of the machine.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>It is plain that when the lever 4-<i>b</i> is moved in the path of
the pin 4-<i>c</i>, which is turning at all times with the pinion 4-<i>a</i>, by
the right-angled lever 4-<i>d</i>, the gear 4 will be moved forward far
enough for the teeth of the pinion to engage with the teeth of
the large gear. Consequently, the gear 4 would turn one
complete revolution, or until the place which has the teeth cut
out is again adjacent to the pinion, and it would stop at this
point. This one revolution of the gear 4 completes the execution
of one narrowing operation or the narrowing down of one
needle on each needle plate.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 77.</i><br />Top of Automatic Narrowing Machine.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Referring to Fig. 75, number 11 indicates the lever or slide
which is the means provided to make the shift from fashioning
to knitting, and vice versa. When this slide is at its furthermost
position toward the back of the machine it is held there
by a catch, and the knitting mechanism would be in operation
while the fashioning mechanism would be at rest. But immediately
the slide is released from the catch, which is done by
a stud on the chain 12, a spring brings it forward and a
release bar, by means of an inclined plane, is set to disconnect
the large gear 3 (Fig. 75) from the crank wheel 5, when it
gets to the point where the carriages are at the extreme right
end of the needle plates as shown in Figs. 77 and 78. At the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>same time it raises up the right-angled lever 4-<i>d</i> (Fig. 81)
which throws in the lever 4-<i>b</i>, and this of course starts the
fashioning mechanism to work. Just as the gear 4 with the
cam shaft 9 completes its one revolution the slide is set back
again, which permits the gear 3 to connect with the crank
shaft and the gear 4 stops as the cut out teeth come opposite
the small pinion.</p>

<p class='c006'>The several vertical straps which may be seen at or near
the center of Fig. 75 are the mediums through which the
automatic changes are made by studs coming under and raising
them. These studs are attached in their several positions on
the chain 12. We will not go into these further, for while the
construction is somewhat different from what we have had,
the principle is the same. As the studs on the chain come
under the straps, they raise them up and this moves a stop in
the path of the different slides which changes the locks, yarn
carriers, etc.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>The Actual Narrowing Operation</h3>
<p class='c005'>It will be remembered that in narrowing by hand there
were three lines of movement of the decker or narrowing
comb. But lines of movement should not be confused with
direction of movement. An object may be moved in one line,
but if moved back and forth on that line it would move in two
directions.</p>

<p class='c006'>The three lines of movement are as follows: First, it is
moved in a line parallel with an extension of the line of a
needle lengthwise, or same as the arrows 1 and 2 in Fig. 82.
We would move it on this line, and in the direction of arrow 1
to bring the openings in the point of the decker directly over
or above the hooks of the needles. Second, it would be moved
up and down at right angles to its first movement, and in the
direction indicated by arrow 4 to place the openings in the
decker points on the hooks of the needles. With the hooks
of the needles caught in these openings the decker would move
again on its first line, and in the direction indicated by arrow 2
to the point where the latches are above the loops. Then the
deckers push the needles down on the same line, but in the
direction indicated by arrow 1 to the point where the loops
on the needles will close the latches and drop over the hooks
on to the decker points. Then the points raise up with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>loops on them, on the second line again, but in the direction
indicated by arrow 3, to clear the needle hooks.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now we have the third line of movement, which is in
toward the other end of the needle plate, as indicated by
arrow 5, the distance of one needle space carrying the loops
on the decker points. Then they move down on the second
line in the direction indicated by arrow 4, catch the needle
hooks in the openings of the decker points, draw back on first
line, direction of arrow 2 to the point where the loops will
slip off the decker points on to the needles again. The decker
then raises up and retires to its point of rest. This will leave
one empty needle at the end, which is drawn down out of
working position by means which will be explained later.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The knitting mechanism is now started in operation, and
after putting on the proper number of rounds it stops and
the narrowing proceeds as before. If this explanation of the
movements of the decker has been followed carefully by the
reader, he will see that there are but three lines of movement
in the whole narrowing operation proper, though on two of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>these lines the movement is in opposite directions at different
times. To do this automatically only three sources must be
provided for the several movements, as the opposite direction
of movements on the same lines come as a matter of course,
otherwise there could be but one movement in any direction
on one line.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>The source of all of these movements is the shaft upon
which the bevel gear (Figs. 75 and 81) is mounted and is
designated by the number 9 in Figs. 75, 79 and 80. It may be
plainly seen in the illustrations with its irregular surfaced

  <h3 class='c013'>Mounting of the Deckers</h3>
</div>
<p class='c005'>We will take up the manner of mounting the deckers and
the auxiliary parts through the medium of which the narrowing
is done. Referring to Fig. 77, the decker points may be seen
at <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, mounted in a clamp in much the same manner as the
hand deckers were mounted. The decker points, however, are
somewhat different from those used in the hand decker, these
latter being solid, either flat or round, while those on the
automatic machine are half-round or U-shaped, as shown in
Fig. 76, to facilitate placing them on the hooks of the needles.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 81.</i><br />Gear Arrangement for Starting and Stopping the Narrowing Mechanism.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Before proceeding any further, it should be understood
that the narrowing is done on both sets of needles, front and
back, by two separate deckers, therefore most of the parts
connected with this operation that are shown and described,
except the cam shaft 9 and its appurtenances, are in duplicate
on front and back of the machine. The decker point clamp
is a part of a yoke which is clamped on the two rods <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>
(Fig. 77) tight enough to permit no play, yet not so tight but
that it will slide freely endwise on the two rods. There are
four of these on each side, front and back, or two for each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>independent pair of plates and locks. The rods <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> run
the whole length of the machine and have no end movement,
but <i>b</i> is free to move up and down vertically, while <i>c</i> acts
simply as a rocker shaft or pivot upon which to swing the
rod <i>b</i>, together with the clamp and decker <i>a</i>. The rod <i>c</i> is
mounted through and near the end of the arm <i>d</i>, which in its
turn is mounted or pivoted on the rocker shaft 13, Fig. 78,
where the whole arm may be noted. In Fig. 73 the whole
five arms that are on the front of the machine may be seen.
These arms are connected with a lever beneath the needle
plates and frame by two flexible straps shown at <i>f</i>, Fig. 77.
The lever to which the other end of these straps are attached
may be seen at 1, Fig. 80, also the extension of the arm <i>d</i>, at <i>d</i>-1.
The spring which is attached to this extension with the other
end attached to a like extension on the opposite arm <i>d</i>, is
shown at <i>d</i>-2. This spring provides the energy to return the
arms to, and hold them in the position shown in Fig. 77, after
the narrowing operation is completed.</p>

<p class='c006'>To get the endwise movement of the decker, or the movement
we have designated as 1 and 2 in Fig. 82, we will refer
again to Fig. 80 and the lever 1. This lever is pivoted on the
shaft 12 and passes under the shaft 9. At the point where it
passes under to one side of the irregular cam <i>d</i>-3 there is
a stud with a roller projecting from one side which comes under
and in contact with the cam <i>d</i>-3. We have seen that there
is always an upward pull on this lever 1 through the springs
<i>d</i>-2, and the extension <i>d</i>-1, the arm proper <i>d</i>, and the straps <i>f</i>
(Fig. 77), back down through the center of the machine to the
inner end of lever 1, Fig. 80.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now it follows, that if the periphery of this cam <i>d</i>-3 is
irregular, and the spring <i>d</i>-2 always holds the pin with the
roller on the side of lever 1, in close contact with the outside
of this cam, then by having the periphery vary, or at different
distances from the center at different points, the deckers may
be moved to any point or held at any point in a line lengthwise
with the decker points by making the irregularities at the
proper place and at the proper distance from the center.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/i124.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 82.</i><br />Lines of Movement Necessary for Narrowing.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The explanation of this movement applies to all of the
automatic movements for narrowing or fashioning on this
machine. Inasmuch as all these irregular cams for the different
movements are mounted on this same shaft 9, after once being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>set right they must always be in synchronism unless the setting
is disturbed by accident. We have seen how the first movement
is secured to bring the openings in the decker points
down to a point directly over the needle hooks. We have
assumed that they were in a line sidewise to begin with. Now
we will see how the second movement, or bringing the deckers
down on to the hooks of the needles after being moved directly
over them, and lifting them off again, is accomplished.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>Second and Third Movements</h3>
<p class='c005'>Referring to Fig. 77, it has been explained how the decker
points with their clamp <i>a</i> and yoke are mounted on the rods
<i>b</i> and <i>c</i> in such a manner that they will swing freely with
the rod <i>c</i> acting as a pivot. Referring to Fig. 78, we find
that the rods <i>c</i> and <i>b</i> have another yoke at <i>i</i>, which is attached
securely to these rods, with a short extension toward the
outside of the machine on which to attach the connection rod <i>h</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>If we now turn to Fig. 79, we will find that the connection
rod <i>h</i> comes down and is attached at the other end to a lever
at <i>j</i>. While, as the reader may surmise, the connection rod <i>h</i>,
Fig. 78, is on the front of the machine, and the rod <i>h</i>, Fig. 79,
is on the back, the connections and manner of moving are the
same. The lever to which this connection rod <i>h</i> (Fig. 79) is
attached at <i>j</i> is mounted on the shaft 13, so as to swing up
and down freely, and has an extension on the other side of
the shaft from which there is another rod connecting it with
the inside end of lever 2.</p>

<p class='c006'>This lever has the proper movements imparted to it through
the pin and roller, which may be plainly seen, resting on the
periphery of an irregular cam, just the same as has been
explained for lever 1 for the first movement, except that the
pin and roller rest on the top of the cam in this instance,
while in the former case the pin and roller were held firmly
up against the bottom of the cam by a coil spring.</p>

<p class='c006'>The third movement to carry the loops in toward the
center one needle, designated in Fig. 82 as 5, is a straight
line movement and always in one direction. But the movement
as to distance must be more exact than either of the others,
therefore while the source of the movement is the same as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>others, an irregular cam on the cam shaft 9, the transmission
of it to the deckers is accomplished in an entirely different
manner.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>Fine Adjustment Necessary</h3>
<p class='c005'>We will refer again to Fig. 77, where we will find two long
flat steel straps, one on each side of the machine, marked
<i>e</i> and <i>e</i>. It will be noted that these straps are attached
securely to the yokes that carry the deckers, as well as to the
crossheads or bridges marked <i>l</i> and <i>m</i>. Reaching across from
one to the other and attached to these bridges is a yoke the
two arms of which are indicated by <i>k</i> and <i>k</i>. These two arms
come together at the center in a hub through which runs the
worm or screw indicated by <i>g</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the outer end of this worm is a small spur gear which
meshes into the gear <i>h</i>. Back of the gear <i>h</i> is a ratchet gear,
and both are rigidly attached to the small shaft and turn
together. Now it is quite evident that if the ratchet and gear
marked <i>h</i> are turned in the right direction, which would be
the top toward the right, this would turn the worm, which
would move the yoke <i>k</i> and <i>k</i>, together with the bridges <i>l</i> and <i>m</i>,
also the straps <i>e</i> and <i>e</i>, and they, of course, would move the
deckers. The principle of the worm or screw used to make
this movement permits an almost micrometer adjustment of
the distance moved.</p>

<p class='c006'>To find the method used to turn the ratchet gear and spur
gear <i>h</i>, we will refer again to Fig. 75, where the ratchet
gear is marked <i>y</i> and its pawl <i>n</i>. This will hardly need an
explanation, as the method of working may be plainly seen
by following out the pawl lever to the connection rod <i>x</i>, and
down to the lever 8, which is raised the proper distance at
just the proper time by the cam directly under it, and in this
manner turns the ratchet.</p>

<p class='c006'>In narrowing, when it comes to the point where the decker
is to be placed on the needle hooks, it is imperative that the
latches of those needles on which the transferring is to be
done are all open, otherwise the decker will not catch the hook.
Also after narrowing down one needle, the empty needle must
be drawn down out of the operating position. The manner of
doing this is as follows: The needles used in this machine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>have an extension of the shank, and on the lower end of this
there is another butt as shown at <i>b</i>, Fig. 76. This extra butt
is there solely for the manipulation of the needles for this
purpose. Just before the decker is ready to drop on to the
needle hooks, the needles are pushed up part way to meet
it by the hoe-shaped part designated by the letter <i>o</i> in Fig. 78.
This hoe is attached to the block <i>p</i>, which in its turn is
attached to the long steel strap 17, then the whole is mounted
on a slide directly beneath the strap upon which it may slide
lengthwise of the machine.</p>

<p class='c006'>The slide is attached to the connecting strap 19, the other
end of which is attached to the lever 20, therefore the hoe <i>o</i>
and the block <i>p</i> may be moved lengthwise of the machine by
the strap 17, and the whole, including the slide beneath and
the connecting strap 19, may be moved up and down on a
line with the movement of the needles by swinging the lever
20, which is pivoted on the rod 18. As the deckers make their
first movement down to align the openings over the needle
hooks, the hoe <i>o</i> is moved upward by the lever 20, and,
inasmuch as it is directly under and contiguous to the lower
butts of the needles, it will push those needles up ahead of it to
the point where the loops will open and lie across the latches,
thus leaving the needle hooks free to receive the deckers. The
hoe then retires while the deckers push the needles down, but
is used a number of times in the same manner to assist the
deckers in the manipulation of the needles during the narrowing
operation. In the meantime it is moved over toward the
center of the machine at the same time the deckers are, as it
also is connected with the yoke <i>k</i> and <i>k</i>, Fig. 77.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the deckers are finishing their part of the work, the hoe
is moved upward again and a hooked finger, which lies just at
the right and is almost wholly concealed by the hoe, hooks over
the empty needle butt and draws the needle down out of the
operating position as the hoe retires to the position shown.</p>

<p class='c006'>The fabric photograph shown in Fig. 74 is part of a storm
collar made for a Shaker sweater. The wide part is that part
of the collar that covers from the top of the shoulder down to
where the narrowing stops at the center of the breast. The
narrow strip is a part of the border on the front opening upon
which is placed the buttons and button-holes. It is narrowed
down five needles, with four rounds between in the first part,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>while the last part has nine narrowings with one round
between.</p>

<p class='c006'>On this machine, while the narrowing is all automatic,
after each garment or part is finished it is necessary to reset
the machine by hand, that is, push up those needles that have
been narrowed down, move the deckers and hoe back to the
starting point by turning the crank <i>i</i>, Fig. 77, then move the
carriages across and put in either a comb, or a hook made
specially for this purpose, to hold down the stitches on the
needles just pushed up into working position. Letter <i>j</i> indicates
the yarn leading into the yarn carrier. The numbers 15 in
Figs. 79 and 80 indicate the board or stand upon which the
yarn is placed for use in the machine.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_8 c012'><span class='sc'>So</span> far as the knitting mechanism is concerned, the flat
jacquard machine is designed and constructed along the
same lines as the ordinary flat machine, with the card
cylinder for cards and the other necessary appurtenances
added. Fig. 83 is a general view of a Dubied jacquard
machine, which is semi-automatic but operated by hand. This
illustration and the other photographs for this chapter were
secured through the courtesy of D. Nusbaum &amp; Co.</p>

<p class='c006'>The card cylinder and cards are practically the same as
used on the purl stitch machine and explained in a former
chapter, but obviously the application must be somewhat
different owing to the different construction and manner of
operating the needles in this machine. Inasmuch as there are
two sets of needles opposed one to the other, and each set
forms the stitches which show on their respective sides of the
fabric, it is possible and customary to make the designs in
solid colors, differing in this respect from the links and links or
purl stitch machine.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The jacquard designed fabrics are usually made in what
would, on an ordinary machine, be the one and one rib or plain
stitch. The tuck or cardigan stitch is not resorted to to bring
out the design as in some other systems. Strictly speaking,
however, the stitch is not what could properly be called a rib
stitch, but is a combination of a plain rib and jersey stitch
when made on the single jacquard, and is almost wholly of
the jersey stitch construction when made on the double jacquard
where the design is brought out on both sides of the fabric.
The single jacquard is so called when the jacquard arrangement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>is on one plate only, usually the back one. The double
jacquard machine is one which has the jacquard attachment
on both the front and back plates. With the single jacquard
the design can be brought out on one side of the fabric only,
while with the double jacquard the design may be brought
out on both sides of the fabric, but the colors would be
reversed.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>Type of Fabric Produced</h3>
</div>
<p class='c005'>Before going into the mechanical construction of the attachment
we will to some extent analyze the fabric to find out
what must be done to produce it. Referring to Fig. 87, which is
a photographic reproduction of a fabric made on the machine
under discussion, it will be noted that both the design and the
ground are in solid colors. The rectangular figures which might
be called the design are in solid black, while the squares, both
the large ones and the small ones, which would be the ground,
are solid white. It should be understood that there are two
yarn carriers used in making this fabric, one for the white
yarn and one for the black, and that these carriers are changed
every round; that is, one round of white, and one round of
black, alternating throughout the fabric.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now inasmuch as we know that the fabric is made in the
plain stitch, it is quite obvious that in order to make this
design means must be provided to permit only those needles
to knit which are making the white ground on any course in
which the carrier with the white yarn is being used. Similarly
only those needles making the black design must be permitted
to knit on the course in which the carrier with the black yarn
is used. The needles or wales, of course, run vertically in the
fabric, while the rectangular design is diagonal, therefore it
is plain that the number of needles or their relative positions
must be changed each course.</p>

<p class='c006'>In this fabric the design is brought out on one side only,
the back plate, and the needles on the opposite side or front
plate are knitting each time the carriage is moved across the
machine as explained in detail later. This may be plainly
seen in Fig. 87, where the corner is turned over to show the
back of the fabric.</p>

<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 85.</i><br />Back and End of Jacquard Machine Showing Details of Necessary Movements.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Now to find the method of selecting the proper needles at
the proper time we will refer first to Fig. 86, which is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>photographic reproduction of the cam system used in this
machine; also to Fig. 90, which is a drawing of a cross section
of the needle plates. It will be noted in Fig. 90 that there
are two separate needle plates. The top one is for the needles
proper, while the lower one is for the auxiliary needles.</p>

<p class='c006'>These two plates are in perfect alignment, both as to the
surface and the needle tricks or slots. In the double jacquard
the front plate would be in two parts and a duplicate of the
back plate, but in the single jacquard the front side would
have what is the upper plate on the back side only, and would
use the short needles as shown at <i>b</i>, Fig. 89.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 86.</i><br />Construction and Arrangement of Cams and Locks in Dubied Jacquard<br />Machine.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 class='c013'>The Cam System</h3>

<p class='c005'>Referring now to the cam system shown in Fig. 86, it will
be noted that while in general appearance the upper and
lower set of locks are similar, the wing or stitch cam <i>l</i> and <i>m</i>
are not only different in shape from the lower wing cams <i>f</i> and
<i>g</i>, but they are set differently in their relation to the V or rise
cams <i>a</i> and <i>c</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cams as shown are set in the proper position to make
jacquard or design work. The upper rise cams <i>c</i>, <i>d</i> and <i>e</i> are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>drawn up into the plate out of working position, therefore
those needles selected to operate on any course must be raised
by the lower rise cams <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. The upper lock operates on
the butts of the needles proper shown at <i>b</i>, Fig. 90, while the
lower lock operates upon the auxiliary needles shown at <i>a</i> in
the same illustration. Now, then it is plain that the needles
proper will not be raised up, therefore cannot draw new loops
or knit unless they are raised by the auxiliary needles <i>a</i>, Fig.
90, which in their turn are raised by the cams <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, Fig. 86.
But it should be noted that the auxiliary needles are drawn
down below the point of the rise cams <i>a</i> on each course, as
the wing cams <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> extend below these corners, therefore, on
every course, unless one of the wing cams <i>f</i> or <i>g</i> is drawn up
into the cam plate out of working position, all of the auxiliary
needles are drawn down out of working position and will not
operate on the next succeeding course unless put into working
position by other means.</p>

<p class='c006'>These wing cams <i>f</i> and <i>g</i>
are chamfered off on the outside,
so that any auxiliary
needles pushed up above the
lower end and into operating
position will slide under and
raise them up into the cam
plate. The inner edge is a
square corner consequently will,
upon coming in contact with the
needle butts, draw them down
out of the working position.
The auxiliary needles being a
separate unit have no effect on
the needles proper on their
downward movement, but must,
of course, raise them on the
upward movement by coming in
contact with the lower ends.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Those of the needles proper
that are moved up into work
are brought down again and form new loops by the stitch cams
<i>l</i> and <i>m</i>, Fig. 86. The small triangular cams <i>j</i> and <i>k</i> are for
clearing the needles when a very short stitch is being drawn
by the stitch cams <i>l</i> and <i>m</i>.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>How Needles Are Selected</h3>
</div>
<p class='c005'>Now to show how the needles are selected we will first
refer to Fig. 89, which shows the needle proper at <i>b</i> and the
auxiliary needle at <i>a</i>. The auxiliary needle has a joint in it
as shown at <i>h</i> to permit the lower end <i>e</i> to swing to the position
shown by the dotted line <i>i</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Fig. 90 shows the auxiliary needles in position with the
card cylinder and cards in place ready to push them up into
operation. Those needles which it is desired not to operate
at all, such as the needles at the end of the plate that may
not be needed, are drawn down and the ends are turned down
to the point where they are at right angles to the plate, as
shown by the dotted line at <i>i</i>. When they are in this position
the cards cannot of course push them up into operating position.
The short nib that looks like a part of a needle, indicated at <i>f</i>,
and the card cylinder shown at <i>g</i> are not a part of the mechanism
under consideration, but are another method of needle
selection which will be explained later.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Fig. 84 is a general view of
the back of the machine showing
a set of cards on the card
cylinder ready for work. Fig.
85 shows the mechanism used
to bring the cylinder with the
cards into action. The cards
and cylinder need no distinguishing
mark as they should be
easily recognized from what
has gone before. The same
thing applies to the auxiliary
needles just above, part of which
are turned down to the point
where they cannot be put into
operation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Letter <i>j</i> indicates the end of
the shaft upon which the card
cylinder is mounted, and <i>c</i> is the elongated opening in which
it moves up and down. This opening is on the same diagonal
plane as the needle plates and has its duplicate at the other
end which carries the other end of the card cylinder. The
rocker shaft <i>d</i> is mounted just under the card cylinder and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>has two levers securely attached, the other ends of which are
connected to the card cylinder shaft, one at either end. On
the outer end of the rocker shaft <i>d</i> is another lever indicated
by the letter <i>e</i>. This is connected to the camway <i>h</i> through
the extension <i>k</i>. This camway is mounted in such a manner
that it can be moved only in one direction, and that direction
is up and down diagonally or on the same plane as the back
needle plates.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the carriage reaches the extreme end of its travel the
pin <i>g</i>, which is attached to the carriage, enters and follows the
camway. Inasmuch as the cams are set on an incline this pin
or plunger must raise the camway together with the end of
the lever <i>e</i>. Through the rocker shaft <i>d</i> and the two levers
before mentioned as connecting the rocker shaft with the card
cylinder, this will bring the card cylinder up to the lower edge
of the auxiliary needle plate. This action will of course push
all those needles into action that come in contact with the
particular card that may be on that side of the card cylinder at
the time. Where the openings are cut in this card the needles
will pass through and have no contact, therefore will not be
pushed up into working position.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the card cylinder returns to its lowest position it is
turned a quarter turn by the stationary hooked dog <i>a</i>, which
catches a tooth, of which there are four, of a ratchet wheel
which is also securely attached to the card cylinder shaft. In
this way the card cylinder is turned a quarter turn each time
it is moved up to the auxiliary plate, which brings a new
card into position to make another selection of needles for the
next course.</p>

<p class='c006'>Letter <i>f</i> indicates a counterweight which, as will be noted,
is attached to the rocker shaft <i>d</i> to assist in returning the card
cylinder to its lowest position and hold it there after its
return. Letter <i>i</i> indicates an ordinary pattern chain on which
the proper studs are attached to change the yarn carriers automatically.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>Three Units May Be Racked</h3>
<p class='c005'>In this type of jacquard machine there are three separate
and distinct units which may be racked or moved at right
angles to the movement of the needles. They are, first, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>needle plate proper which racks the same as the ordinary flat
machine; second, the auxiliary needle plate; and third, the card
cylinder together with the cards.
The racking of the needle plate
proper is necessary to make
those designs in which a rack in
the fabric is required, but the
other two are chiefly a matter
of convenience to save making
up cards. There are many designs
that may be made with
one or four cards, or even without
any cards, by manipulation
of these racking movements,
where otherwise quite a string
of cards would be required.</p>

<div  class='figleft id005'>
<img src='images/i138.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 89.</i><br />Needles Proper and Auxiliary Needles<br />Used in Jacquard Machine.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We will take for example
any design consisting of a small
block or check within the limits
of the needles the auxiliary
plate will rack over. Such a
design may be made without
cards in this way. Say we wish
to make a black and white
check four needles wide and
four courses high. We would
put up into operating position four auxiliary needles and draw
four down, alternating in this way with four up and four down
for the width of the fabric. Then, referring to Fig. 86, we
would draw up out of operating position as shown the rise
cams <i>c</i>, <i>d</i> and <i>e</i>, also the wing cams <i>f</i> and <i>g</i>. This would
permit the alternating four auxiliary needles we have left in
operating position to always stay in this position. Now, after
putting on one round or two courses of, let us say, white we
would rack the auxiliary plate over four needles and then put
on a round of black; rack back the four needles and put on a
round of white, rack the other way four needles and put on a
round of black. If we could see the fabric made thus far we
would find that we had a row of blocks or checks four needles
wide and four courses high. For although we have put on
four courses each of the black and white, which makes eight
courses in all, each color has been put on its own group of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>four needles; therefore the whole will build up the fabric but
four courses. If we continued to operate the machine in the
same manner we would get alternate black and white stripes,
each four needles wide.</p>

<p class='c006'>To break them up into checks or squares we would at this
point have to either skip racking once while continuing the
change of carriers each round, or miss changing carriers once
while continuing the rack of four needles each round. This
change must of course be made every four rounds throughout
the length of the fabric, or as long as it is desired to make the
check. It should be remembered that it is the auxiliary plate
that is racked in this case, and not the needles proper; therefore
the rack does not show in the fabric. But the shifting
of these alternate sets of four auxiliary needles each round
causes alternate groups of four of the needles proper to knit,
the set which knits depending on which way the auxiliary plate
is racked.</p>

<p class='c006'>This same check design may be made with one card
properly cut by preventing the card cylinder from turning and
racking, or moving the card cylinder back and forth four
needles in the same manner as the auxiliary plate was moved.
Or it may be made with four cards without moving either the
plate or card cylinder. In this case it would be necessary to
use all the auxiliary needles and lower the wing cams <i>f</i> and <i>g</i>,
Fig. 86, into action.</p>

<div  class='figleft id005'>
<img src='images/i139.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'><i>Fig. 90.</i><br />Cross Section of Needle Plates and Card Cylinder.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In making a fabric on a
double jacquard machine which
shows the design on one side
only, it is good practice to put
four cards on the front cylinder
properly cut to put alternate
needles into operation on alternate
courses, in order to prevent
putting more courses on the
front plate than on the back.
Or to explain it in another way,
the needle in the back plate that
makes the white part of the
design knit only on the rounds
on which the white thread carrier
is used, and the needles that make the black parts operate
only when the carrier with the black yarn is in use.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Now it is plain that if all the needles in the front plate are
permitted to knit each round we would have approximately
twice as many courses on the front as on the back. This is
obviated, as stated before, by using cards on the front card
cylinder to push up into operation every alternate needle when
moving the carriage say from left to right, and permitting
these to remain idle and pushing those not operated on this
course into operation on the return course from right to left.
While this is desirable it is not essential, for it cannot be done
on a single jacquard, though there are many nice designs and
fabrics made on this machine.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>Explanation of Pattern</h3>
<p class='c005'>Fig. 87 shows a fabric made on a double jacquard machine
with both card cylinders in operation. Before going any
further it should be understood that both the front and back
card cylinders can be operated and make a new selection of
needles at the end of each course, or when the carriage is at
the end of its travel at both ends of the machine. This design
is made by operating the card cylinders in this way. Fig. 88
is a layout of the design shown in Fig. 87. It is one complete
repeat of the design as shown by the square box in Fig. 87.
All the rest of the fabric is simply a repetition of this, but
when grouped together on a large piece of fabric they appear
entirely different.</p>

<p class='c006'>As may be seen in Fig. 88, it would take 36 cards to make
this design. In cutting the cards for this we would cut out
the places shown blank and leave the card whole to push the
needles into operation in the places marked by an <i>x</i> or an <i>o</i>.
This cutting would of course have to be repeated the width
of the fabric, or the length of each card.</p>

<p class='c006'>The principle as explained is used on all makes of flat
jacquard knitting machines, but the method used to put the
needles into operation by the cards differs with the different
builders. For example, one popular method is shown in Fig.
90, where the card cylinder is placed directly below the under
surface of the auxiliary plate as shown at <i>g</i>, and acts on a
short nib with the butt turned downward and extending through
the plate as shown at <i>f</i>. With this method it is customary to
use a long needle with two butts as shown in Fig. 89 at <i>f</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>instead of the short one with an auxiliary needle. Also with
this method the needle plate would be a single wide plate with
the tricks or needle slots cut gradually deeper as they reached
the lower edge, so that at the point where the lower butts
of the needles come the trick is deep enough so that the needle
may be depressed to bring the top of the lower butts flush, or
just below, the top surface of the needle plate. When operating
the machine these butts always remain in this position, therefore
will not knit unless raised up and put into operation by
the cards.</p>

<p class='c006'>If we should cut a set of cards just the reverse of the set
laid out in Fig. 88, that is, cut out where these are not, and
leave uncut where these are cut, and put this set on the front
card cylinder and operate them in conjunction with and
opposite to the back set, we would have the same design on
both sides of the fabric, but the colors would be reversed.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
